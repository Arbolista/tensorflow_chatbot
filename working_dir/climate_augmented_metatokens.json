However, the occurrence of such changes becomes increasingly more likely as the perturbation of the climate system progresses.", 
  "AEPHQZRMIESHFGFHK": "Even if the Paris targets are achieved, some adaptation will be essential. So how do we reduce vulnerability, minimise costs and maximise opportunities? Given the changes already observed with the roughly 1\u2103 of global warming so far, it\u2019s fair to say that more severe impacts will occur during this century.  Keeping warming within 2\u2103 and moving to a lower-carbon world presents many challenges. Considerable work will be needed to help identify climate-resilient pathways and allow humans to adapt to the changes.  Successful adaptation will require an ability to foresee and prepare for inevitable changes in the likelihoods of extreme climate events from year to year. Development of climate forecasts on timescales of a year to decades may provide opportunities to reduce losses in critical sectors such as water, agriculture, infrastructure, tourism, fisheries, energy and natural resources.", 
  "AFDKHUWLQMIONLFL": "No. Since accurate satellite-based measurements of solar output began in 1978, the amount of the sun\u2019s energy reaching Earth has slightly decreased, which should, on its own, result in slightly lower temperatures; but the Earth\u2019s temperature has continued to rise. The sun can explain less than 10% of the increase in temperature since 1750, and none of the increase in temperature since 1960. ", 
  "AJCMZRHFADWFQEFCO": "Climate change is already exacerbating food insecurity, and represents a real threat to the world\u2019s growing population and to the stability of local communities and nations. By increasing the frequency and intensity of droughts, floods, and storms, climate change can destroy crops and the infrastructure necessary to transport and store food supplies. Increased rainfall and warmer temperatures will change the weather patterns that farmers are accustomed to, making it more difficult for them to plan their plantings and harvests.  Though plants need carbon dioxide to grow, higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are not necessarily beneficial for agriculture. Researchers have found that higher levels of CO2 result in crops with lower nutritional value.", 
  "AJRRFRMRTSITOFJY": "Climate and climate variability are determined by three main factors:  The amount of incoming solar radiation. This is affected by changes in the Earth's orbit around the Sun and in the Sun's brightness. The chemical composition of the atmosphere. For example, changes in the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere affect how much radiation (solar radiation that is re- emitted from the earth's surface as infrared radiation) passes from the earth into space and how much stays behind to warm the planet. The surface characteristics of the Earth. Certain Earth surface features, such as ice sheets, increase the amount of solar radiation that is reflected back into space. These three factors and ways that they interact with one another have all contributed to the climate patterns and variability we see in earth's history. However, the fact that climate has changed without human influence in the past does not mean that current climate change is following 'natural' patterns. The factor that best explains the observed global warming over the last century is the increase of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (IPCC 2007), largely caused by the burning of fossil fuels and other human activity.", 
  "AJZLFGVCYRUWNGJX": "Claims have been made that the surface temperature measurements are tainted by the proximity of data-generating thermometers to cities. While amplified warming does occur in urban areas and is an important local phenomenon, a number of independent and recent scientific studies have shown that urbanization is a negligible effect as far as continental- and hemispheric-space averages are concerned. Over land, temperature data come from fixed weather observing stations with thermometers housed in special instrument shelters. Records of temperature from many thousands of such stations exist. Some are in urban areas. Many are not.  One concern regarding the construction of global temperature records is the variety of changes that may affect temperature measurements at an individual station. For example, the thermometer or instrument shelter might change, the time of day when the thermometers are read might change, or the station might move. These problems are addressed through a variety of procedures (for example, checking for consistency with data from neighboring stations) that have proven to be very effective. Other, perhaps more subtle influences (e.g., urbanization) are addressed either actively in the data processing stage or through dataset evaluation to ensure as much as possible that the data are not biased. For instance, several studies have compared global surface temperature time series made up of only rural stations with the \"standard\" global temperature time series, only to find out that there is no significant bias.", 
  "ANMKHVYNIBLVIFIXS": "Global average temperatures are currently increasing at greater rates than those that have occurred over the last million years of Earth's history. Global average temperatures started rapidly rising during the 1900's as the industrial revolution was accelerating and as humans started relying more heavily on burning fossil fuels for energy (see Figure 4).  For the past 100 years, we have clear records of the increasing rate of global temperature change. The decade beginning January 2000 and ending December 2009 was the warmest decade in the modern record (since 1880), with 2010 tied with 2005 as the warmest year on record (NASA 2011). From the 1910s to the 1940s, global average temperatures increased by 0.35 \u00b0C, and for an equivalent time period from the 1970s to 2006, global average temperatures increased by 0.55 \u00b0C (IPCC 2007), reflecting an increasing rate of change.  The Earth's temperature has undergone some large changes in the past; according to proxy data, global average temperatures did change by as much as 4\u00b0C to 7\u00b0C between ice ages and warm interglacial periods. However, this change took approximately 5,000 years (IPCC 2007). Current rapid rates of global climate change are clearly very unusual in the context of past changes. More abrupt shifts may have occurred in the past at smaller, regional scales due to ocean heat transport, but did not likely affect the global mean temperature (IPCC 2007).", 
  "APBNGKWUWLXJJCQFY": "In recent years, the United States has taken significant steps (both at the federal and state levels) to combat global warming by increasing the nation\u2019s use of renewable energy and curbing greenhouse gas emissions through energy efficiency initiatives and carbon pollution standards. When signing the Paris Climate Agreement in 2016, the United States committed to making further cuts to carbon emissions with the aim of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius in the 21st century.  In 2015, President Barack Obama proposed the Clean Power Plan, which would have reduced carbon emissions from existing power plants by at least 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Substantial gains have already been made, with U.S. emissions from the power sector being at the lowest point since 1991. The power sector had been the nation\u2019s largest source of carbon pollution, at 31 percent of the total; at present, the transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions.  The Trump Administration has rolled back several of the previous administration's climate actions, including the Clean Power Plan. But states, including California and New York, are moving forward with policies to curb carbon emissions and favor renewable energy and energy efficiency. As of September 2016, 20 states and the District of Columbia have set their own greenhouse gas reduction targets.",

  "BAPIHZHVHGBTTMAOGWQ": "Climate on Earth has changed on all time scales, including long before human activity could have played a role. Great progress has been made in understanding the causes and mechanisms of these climate changes. Changes in Earth\u2019s radiation balance were the principal driver of past climate changes, but the causes of such changes are varied. For each case \u2013 be it the Ice Ages, the warmth at the time of the dinosaurs or the fluctuations of the past millennium \u2013 the specific causes must be established individually. In many cases, this can now be done with good confidence, and many past climate changes can be reproduced with quantitative models.", 
  "BHOKHSVOHKMDHQQIK": "Certain gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, help trap the sun's heat in the atmosphere. Known as greenhouse gases, they exist naturally in the atmosphere and help keep the Earth\u2019s surface warm enough to sustain life (without greenhouse gases, the average temperature on Earth would be a mere zero degrees Fahrenheit, instead of today's roughly 58.3 degrees Fahrenheit).  Human activities, notably the burning of fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil) to power vehicles, factories, and homes, release additional carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Other activities, such as raising livestock, increase methane levels. Higher concentrations of these greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap more heat on Earth, causing a manmade rise in global temperatures. According to multiple reviews of the scientific literature, an overwhelming 97 percent of climate scientists agree that human activity is the main driver behind the global warming we are experiencing.", 
  "BIKNKHUVSXOQOYD": "The environmental pressures from global agriculture are enormous. Global demand for beef and for animal feed, for instance, has led farmers to cut down large swaths of the Amazon forest.  Brazil adopted tough oversight and managed to cut deforestation in the Amazon by 80 percent in a decade. But the gains there are fragile, and severe problems continue in other parts of the world, such as aggressive forest clearing in Indonesia.  Scores of companies and organizations, including major manufacturers of consumer products, signed a declaration in New York in 2014 pledging to cut deforestation in half by 2020, and to cut it out completely by 2030. The companies that signed the pact are now struggling to figure out how to deliver on that promise.  Many forest experts consider meeting the pledge to be difficult, but possible. They say consumers must keep up the pressure on companies that use ingredients like palm oil in products ranging from soap to lipstick to ice cream. People can also help the cause by altering their diets to eat less meat, and particularly less beef.", 
  "BKKCSFWBTYRRUTJD": "Because of the long lifetime of carbon dioxide and the slow equilibration of the oceans, there is a substantial future commitment to further global climate change even in the absence of further emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Several modeling groups have performed \"commitment\" runs in order to examine the climate response even if the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had been stabilized in the year 2000. The exact results depend upon the model, but they all show a further global warming of about another 0.5\u00b0C, and additional and significant sea level rises caused by thermal expansion of the oceans by the end of the 21st Century. Further glacial melt is also likely.", 
  "BKYWVHEJALAAWZQG": "Humans are affecting the climate by increasing the amount of greenhouse gases present in the atmosphere and by changing the surface characteristics of the land (see discussion about \"albedo\"). Activities such as fossil fuel burning, land-use change (e.g. deforestation), animal husbandry, and practicing fertilizer-dependent agriculture lead to increases in greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). These contribute to the greenhouse effect and cause the surface temperature of the Earth to increase. Global atmospheric concentrations of CO2, CH4 and N2O have increased markedly since 1750 as a result of human activities, and now far exceed pre- industrial values (IPCC 2007, Chapter 2).", 
  "BPUADQAAYOFRBSOEZ": "Much more simply than you might think since, of course, all models are indeed wrong (though some are useful \u2013 George Box). Showing a mismatch between the real world and the observational data is made much easier if you recall the signal-to-noise issue we mentioned above. As you go to smaller spatial and shorter temporal scales the amount of internal variability increases markedly and so the number of diagnostics which will be different to the expected values from the models will increase (in both directions of course). So pick a variable, restrict your analysis to a small part of the planet, and calculate some statistic over a short period of time and you\u2019re done. If the models match through some fluke, make the space smaller, and use a shorter time period and eventually they won\u2019t. Even if models get much better than they are now, this will always work \u2013 call it the RealClimate theory of persistence. Now, appropriate statistics can be used to see whether these mismatches are significant and not just the result of chance or cherry-picking, but a surprising number of papers don\u2019t bother to check such things correctly.

  "BZACROFSULSMURDYPZ": "Scientists have published strong evidence that the warming climate is making heat waves more frequent and intense. It is also causing heavier rainstorms, and coastal flooding is getting worse as the oceans rise because of human emissions. Global warming has intensified droughts in regions like the Middle East, and it may have strengthened a recent drought in California.  In many other cases, though, the linkage to global warming for particular trends is uncertain or disputed. That is partly from a lack of good historical weather data, but it is also scientifically unclear how certain types of events may be influenced by the changing climate.  Another factor: While the climate is changing, people\u2019s perceptions may be changing faster. The Internet has made us all more aware of weather disasters in distant places. On social media, people have a tendency to attribute virtually any disaster to climate change, but in many cases there is little or no scientific support for doing so.", 
  "CDOIAXVFZOFMGLF": "Average global surface temperatures are projected to increase by 1.1 to 6.4\u00b0C (2 to 11.5\u00b0F) by the end of the 21st century, relative to 1980-1990, with a best estimate of 1.8 to 4.0\u00b0C (3.2 to 7.2\u00b0F) (IPCC 2007). This large range in projections is due in part to the fact that we do not know whether greenhouse gas emissions will continue at their current levels, increase, or decrease. Temperature projections do vary regionally, with the highest projected warming taking place near the poles (USGCRP 2009). These temperature changes will continue to have effects on ice extent, snow cover, sea level, and many other factors. See the 'Ecosystem Effects' section of the FAQs for more detail.  Precipitation changes over the next century are more complex and uncertain, and differ within regions and sub-regions. Current models indicate that precipitation will generally increase in higher latitudes and in the tropical Pacific during the monsoon (rainy) seasons, and decrease in the subtropical dry belt. In the U.S. the Southwest is expected to become drier while northern regions may see an increase in precipitation (USGCRP 2009). Overall, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts, storms, heavy downpours, and heavy snowfall are projected to increase.", 
  "CIFIGYBYJKRYTGEEJC": "Renewable sources of energy come from natural resources, like sunlight, plant matter (biomass), geothermal activity, water, and wind, that are not depleted when used (or can be regrown, in the case of plant matter). In contrast, nonrenewable sources of energy\u2014like fossil fuels\u2014are finite resources that cannot be easily replenished when consumed. Renewable energy is also a low- or zero-carbon source of energy. And, of course, energy efficiency is a very important \"renewable\" source of energy: the cleanest form of energy is energy that is not used.  Common sources of renewable energy are solar, wind, geothermal, and hydro power as well as certain forms of biomass. Renewable technologies like wind turbines and solar panels have become increasingly competitive in the energy market as their production costs continue to fall. Increasing world investment in renewable energy technologies has been acknowledged by the overwhelming majority of climate change experts and world leaders to be an essential strategy in addressing global warming.", 
  "CLSZCKKEAOBOCLOETBI": "It is very unlikely that the 20th-century warming can be explained by natural causes. The late 20th century has been unusually warm. Palaeoclimatic reconstructions show that the second half of the 20th century was likely the warmest 50-year period in the Northern Hemisphere in the last 1300 years. This rapid warming is consistent with the scientific understanding of how the climate should respond to a rapid increase in greenhouse gases like that which has occurred over the past century, and the warming is inconsistent with the scientific understanding of how the climate should respond to natural external factors such as variability in solar output and volcanic activity. Climate models provide a suitable tool to study the various influences on the Earth\u2019s climate. When the effects of increasing levels of greenhouse gases are included in the models, as well as natural external factors, the models produce good simulations of the warming that has occurred over the past century. The models fail to reproduce the observed warming when run using only natural factors. When human factors are included, the models also simulate a geographic pattern of temperature change around the globe similar to that which has occurred in recent decades. This spatial pattern, which has features such as a greater warming at high northern latitudes, differs from the most important patterns of natural climate variability that are associated with internal climate processes, such as El Ni\u00f1o. ", 
  "CMPQZIYYZFGMJPKF": "Some of the strongest evidence to support the view that human activities are causing the Earth to warm comes from numerical experiments performed with state-of-the-art global climate models. These models encapsulate the current understanding of the physical processes involved in the climate system, the interactions, and the performance of the system as a whole. They have been extensively tested and evaluated using observations. Today's best climate models are now able to reproduce the climate of the past century, and simulations of the evolution of global surface temperature over the past millennium are consistent with paleoclimate reconstructions.  As a result, climate modelers are able to test the role of various forcings in producing the observed changes in global temperature. Forcings imposed on the climate system can be natural in origin, such as changes in solar luminosity or volcanic eruptions, or human-induced, such as increases in aerosol and greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.  Climate model simulations that account for such changes in forcings have now reliably shown that global surface warming of recent decades is a response to the increased concentrations of greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere. An example, from a climate model simulation performed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), is provided in Figure 1. When the model is integrated forward in time over the 20th Century with only information on imposed natural forcings, there is no discernible trend in global surface temperatures over the last several decades (blue line). When changes in greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations are added to these natural forcings, however, the model not only simulates an increase in global surface temperature (red line), but it almost exactly reproduces the observed rate of change (black line). Numerous simulations for each case are run, and the solid lines represent the mean while the shaded regions indicate the \"spread\" about the mean. This spread reflects intrinsic natural climate variations arising from purely internal atmospheric processes as well as from interactions among the different components of the climate system, such as those between the atmosphere and oceans or the atmosphere and land.  Such results, which have also been produced by several other independent modeling groups, increase our confidence in the observational record and our understanding of how global mean temperature has changed. They also indicate the time histories of the important forcings are reasonably known, and the climate processes being simulated in models are adequate enough to make the models very valuable tools for investigating the causes and processes of past climate variations as well future climate change.", 
  "CNLWAVWHXLTHVTBN": "The Earth has experienced many large climate changes in the past. However, current changes in climate are unusual for two reasons: first, many lines of evidence demonstrate that these changes are primarily the result of human activities (see Question I for more info); and second, these changes are occurring (and are projected to continue to occur) faster than many past changes in the Earth\u2019s climate.",

  "DEFBOUXLCNNDKQXP": "Humans have caused major climate changes to happen already, and we have set in motion more changes still. Even if we stopped emitting greenhouse gases today, global warming would continue to happen for at least several more decades if not centuries. That\u2019s because it takes a while for the planet (for example, the oceans) to respond, and because carbon dioxide \u2013 the predominant heat-trapping gas \u2013 lingers in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. There is a time lag between what we do and when we feel it.  In the absence of major action to reduce emissions, global temperature is on track to rise by an average of 6 \u00b0C (10.8 \u00b0F), according to the latest estimates. Some scientists argue a \u201cglobal disaster\u201d is already unfolding at the poles of the planet; the Arctic, for example, may be ice-free in the summer within just a few years. Yet other experts are concerned about Earth passing one or more \u201ctipping points\u201d \u2013 abrupt, perhaps irreversible changes that tip our climate into a new state.  But it may not be too late to avoid or limit some of the worst effects of climate change. Responding to climate change will involve a two-tier approach: 1) \u201cmitigation\u201d \u2013 reducing the flow of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere; and 2) \u201cadaptation\u201d \u2013 learning to live with, and adapt to, the climate change that has already been set in motion. The key question is: what will our emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants be in the years to come? Recycling and driving more fuel-efficient cars are examples of important behavioral change that will help, but they will not be enough. Because climate change is a truly global, complex problem with economic, social, political and moral ramifications, the solution will require both a globally-coordinated response (such as international policies and agreements between countries, a push to cleaner forms of energy) and local efforts on the city- and regional-level (for example, public transport upgrades, energy efficiency improvements, sustainable city planning, etc.). It\u2019s up to us what happens next. ", 
  "DNMPATTKGZBKSSLHBNP": "The ocean is rising at a rate of about a foot per century. That causes severe effects on coastlines, forcing governments and property owners to spend tens of billions of dollars fighting erosion. But if that rate continued, it would probably be manageable, experts say.  The risk is that the rate will accelerate markedly. If emissions continue unchecked, then the temperature at the Earth\u2019s surface could soon resemble a past epoch called the Pliocene, when a great deal of ice melted and the ocean rose by something like 80 feet compared to today. A recent study found that burning all the fossil fuels in the ground would fully melt the polar ice sheets, raising the sea level by more than 160 feet over an unknown period. Many coastal experts believe that even if emissions stopped tomorrow, 15 or 20 feet of sea-level rise is already inevitable.  The crucial issue is probably not how much the oceans are going to rise, but how fast. And on that point, scientists are pretty much flying blind. Their best information comes from studying the Earth\u2019s history, and it suggests that the rate can on occasion hit a foot per decade, which can probably be thought of as the worst case. Even if the rise is much slower, many of the world\u2019s great cities will flood eventually. Studies suggest that big cuts in emissions could slow the rise, buying crucial time for society to adapt to an altered coastline.",

But such warming hasn't been observed. Rather, warming has occurred in the lower atmosphere (troposphere) and cooling in the upper atmosphere (stratosphere)\u2014which is exactly what would be expected if the warming was due to an increase in heat-trapping gases near the surface. This evidence from temperature records is regarded as a \"smoking gun\" linking today's global warming to the increase in heat-trapping gases in the lower atmosphere.", 
  "EGIDHLFEZWNNBZF": "No. Much of the confusion concerning this point comes from a misunderstanding stemming from the point above. Model development actually does not use the trend data in tuning (see below). Instead, modellers work to improve the climatology of the model (the fit to the average conditions), and it\u2019s intrinsic variability (such as the frequency and amplitude of tropical variability). The resulting model is pretty much used \u2018as is\u2019 in hindcast experiments for the 20th Century.", 
  "EHYCJSPGSRRVDLYV": "In the best case that scientists can imagine, several things happen: Earth turns out to be less sensitive to greenhouse gases than currently believed; plants and animals manage to adapt to the changes that have already become inevitable; human society develops much greater political will to bring emissions under control; and major technological breakthroughs occur that help society to limit emissions and to adjust to climate change.  Some technological breakthroughs are already making cleaner energy more attractive. In the United States, for instance, coal has been losing out to natural gas as a power source, as new drilling technology has made gas more abundant and cheaper; for a given amount of power, gas cuts emissions in half. In addition, the cost of wind and solar power has declined so much that they are now the cheapest power source in a few places, even without subsidies.  Unfortunately, scientists and energy experts say the odds of all these things breaking our way are not very high. The Earth could just as easily turn out to be more sensitive to greenhouse gases as less. Global warming seems to be causing chaos in parts of the natural world already, and that seems likely to get worse, not better. So in the view of the experts, simply banking on rosy assumptions without any real plan would be dangerous. They believe the only way to limit the risks is to limit emissions.", 
  "ELTRNTIIICEYEOBJWD": "\u201cGlobal warming\u201d refers to the long-term warming of the planet.

  "EMTKCLYKMFNJIGCGWI": "Some climate changes currently have beneficial effects for specific sectors or regions. For example, current benefits of warming include longer growing seasons for agriculture and longer ice-free periods for shipping on the Great Lakes. At the same time, however, longer growing seasons, along with higher temperatures and carbon dioxide, can increase pollen production, intensifying and lengthening the allergy season. Longer ice-free periods on the Great Lakes can result in more lake-effect snowfalls. ", 
  "EOPEVUZQNAJKUXRKQI": "Yes, there will probably be some short-term and long-term positive benefits from global warming. For example, the flip side of increased mortality from heat waves may be decreased mortality from cold waves.  In the short term, farmers in some regions may benefit from the earlier onset of spring and from a longer warm season that is suitable for growing crops. Also, studies show that, up to a certain point, crops and other plants grow better in the presence of higher carbon dioxide levels and seem to be more drought-tolerant.[13] But this benefit is a two-edged sword: weeds, many invasive plant species, and insect pests will also thrive in a warmer world. Water availability will be impacted in drier agricultural areas that need irrigation. At some point, the positive benefits to crops of increased carbon dioxide may be overwhelmed by the negative impacts of heat stress and drought.  In the long term, shipping commerce will benefit from the opening of the Northwest Passage for longer periods of the year due to the loss of Arctic sea ice. However, in the long run, if a \"business as usual\" approach to emitting heat-trapping gases is maintained at the present rate, or faster, then the negative costs and impacts of global warming are very likely to far outweigh the positive benefits over the course of this century, with increased potential for catastrophic impacts from more extreme events.[12] In part, this is because any substantial change, whether warmer or colder, would challenge the societal infrastructure that has developed under the current climate.",

Evidence for a changing climate abounds, from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans. Changes in surface, atmospheric, and oceanic temperatures; melting glaciers, snow cover, and sea ice; rising sea level; and increase in atmospheric water vapor have been documented by hundreds of studies conducted by thousands of scientists around the world. Rainfall patterns and storms are changing and the occurrence of droughts is shifting.", 
  "FHBENZIWCCMZNJZYPOW": "The distribution of land and sea distorts the simple picture of global circulation; land heats up and cools down faster than water, leading on a large scale to the Asian monsoon but on a smaller scale to sea breezes, a common phenomenon at the coast, where winds blow from the sea during the day, but from the land during the night. The presence of continents which break up the ocean obviously disrupts the ocean circulation. The presence of mountain ranges deflects the atmospheric flow (for example, the Himalayas affect the monsoon pattern), while patterns of precipitation are determined to a large extent by land-sea contrasts, continental land masses, mountain ranges and so on.  There is a lot less land in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere, so the atmospheric circulation is a lot simpler. For example, the storm tracks are more continuous around the Earth.", 
  "FNGOMLFVYLWLXDXX": "The Sun powers Earth\u2019s climate, radiating energy at very short wavelengths, predominately in the visible or near-visible (e.g., ultraviolet) part of the spectrum. Roughly one-third of the solar energy that reaches the top of Earth\u2019s atmosphere is reflected directly back to space. The remaining two-thirds is absorbed by the surface and, to a lesser extent, by the atmosphere. To balance the absorbed incoming energy, the Earth must, on average, radiate the same amount of energy back to space. Because the Earth is much colder than the Sun, it radiates at much longer wavelengths, primarily in the infrared part of the spectrum (see Figure 1). Much of this thermal radiation emitted by the land and ocean is absorbed by the atmosphere, including clouds, and reradiated back to Earth. This is called the greenhouse effect. The glass walls in a greenhouse reduce airflow and increase the temperature of the air inside. Analogously, but through a different physical process, the Earth\u2019s greenhouse effect warms the surface of the planet. Without the natural greenhouse effect, the average temperature at Earth\u2019s surface would be below the freezing point of water. Thus, Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect makes life as we know it possible. However, human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and clearing of forests, have greatly intensified the natural greenhouse effect, causing global warming. ", 
  "FNKBKZICNIPJNBMS": "This is a question that\u2019s been asked for decades. There is always some danger in picking who first asked it, but glaciologist John Mercer in 1968 is a strong candidate. Mass changes in the ice sheet translate into changes in sea level, and a lot of people live close enough to sea level to be displaced if the ice sheet were to be lost, while many more enjoy the beaches and ports that would be affected.  Many things affect sea level. For example, more snow on an ice sheet \u2014 as we expect on the Antarctic ice sheet and central parts of Greenland in a warming world \u2014 tends to lower sea level by taking water that evaporated from the ocean and storing it on top of an ice sheet. But more melt on an ice sheet \u2014 as we expect in parts of Greenland with warming \u2014 takes water from the ice sheet and puts it back in the ocean, raising sea level. Melting of mountain glaciers has a similar effect as melting the ice sheet, as does pumping of water out of the ground to irrigate crops or for other uses, because most of that water ends up in the ocean rather than back in the ground. Warming the ocean causes expansion of the water and raises sea level. All of these are interesting and important influences, with notable uncertainties, but we don\u2019t think that those uncertainties are huge.  Another way to raise sea level is for ice sheets to spread more rapidly under their own weight, taking ice from above sea level and delivering it to the ocean to make icebergs. This influence on sea level is complicated, and is where various uncertainties arise. Many factors control how rapidly ice flows, and thus how rapidly ice sheets can transfer land ice to the ocean to raise sea level.  Today, around most of Antarctica and parts of Greenland, the ice reaching the ocean does not immediately break off to make icebergs; instead it remains attached while spreading over the ocean, forming an ice shelf. The ice shelves almost all exist in bays or fjords, and thus have friction with their sides; the undersides of many ice shelves also hit local high spots in the seafloor, generating additional friction. Furthermore, the undersides of the ice shelves, where they are in contact with the ocean, are at their melting point. Warming ocean water tends to thin the shelves \u2014 a warming of 1 degree Celsius increases melting by about 10 meters per year \u2014 reducing the friction, and thus allowing faster flow of the ice that feeds the shelves, raising sea level.  Various features of the geologic record, modern observations, and investigations with models point to the importance of \u201cthreshold\u201d behavior. Increasing the ocean temperature increases the ice\u2019s speed, with the potential that at some high-enough temperature, the speed will jump rather abruptly and irreversibly. Such behavior is especially interesting and important, but also difficult to predict. You can undoubtedly think of many questions: What happens if the water temperature stays the same, but the rate of ocean circulation changes? What about warming adding meltwater into crevasses that could wedge them open and remove the friction that way? If an ice shelf is thinned, by how much does the flow speed increase? What are the thresholds?  A large and vigorous community of scientists in the field, remote-sensing experts, and modelers is working to measure, understand, project, and test the projections. And, we\u2019re doing so with some urgency \u2014 we want to get answers in time to provide useful guidance to people making decisions about energy and the environment.", 
  "GDHLEDNZBTGUXXTXVYY": "The Earth\u2019s average temperature has risen by 1.5\u00b0F over the past century, and climate scientists estimate it will rise another 0.5 to 8.6\u00b0F by the end of this century, depending, in part, on future emissions.[1] That may not sound like much to worry about, since most of us experience much greater temperature changes over the course of a day or from season to season. But the global average temperature during the height of the last ice age was only 5 to 9\u00b0F cooler than it is today.[3] Relatively small changes in the planet\u2019s average temperature can mean big changes in local and regional climate, creating risks to public health and safety[4], water resources, agriculture, infrastructure, and ecosystems.[5] Following are some examples: [5] Increasing heat waves: Heat waves have become more frequent in the United States in recent decades. Climate scientists expect the number of days with temperatures above 90\u00b0F to increase in the United States as the climate changes, especially toward the end of this century.  More extreme weather: In addition to heat waves, changes in precipitation patterns, including extreme precipitation events, storms, and floods, are becoming more common and more severe in many regions, and this is expected to continue.  Intensified droughts: Higher temperatures lead to increased rates of evaporation and can lead to more rapid drying of soils. Without reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, longer-term droughts are expected to intensify in much of the Southwest, the Great Plains, and the Southeast. Impacts on crops: Over the past 40 years, climate disruptions to agricultural production have increased, and this is expected to continue. Impacts on health: Climate change is increasing our exposure to extreme temperatures, extreme weather events; degraded air quality; diseases transmitted through food, water, and insects; and stresses to mental health and well-being. These threats to human health are expected to increase with continued climate change. More wildfires: The area burned by wildfire in parts of western North America is expected to double (or more) for each 1.8\u00b0F increase in global average temperature.[6] Rising sea levels: Global sea level has risen by about eight inches since the late 1800s, and is projected to rise another 1 to 4 feet by the end of this century. Flooding is becoming more frequent along the U.S. coastline, especially in the Mid-Atlantic region where the land is simultaneously sinking. Impacts on health: Climate change is increasing our exposure to extreme temperatures, extreme weather events; degraded air quality; diseases transmitted through food, water, and insects; and stresses to mental health and well-being. These threats to human health are expected to increase with continued climate change.", 
  "GFOUGTLXRNMUQGWLX": "Climate varies naturally. We consider natural variability as resulting from purely internal atmospheric processes as well as from interactions among the different components of the climate system, such as those between the atmosphere and oceans or the atmosphere and land. However, the most significant forcings with impact on climatic time scales are generally imposed upon the climate system.  External forcings arise from a wide array of processes covering a range of spatial and temporal scales. \"Natural\" external forcings include changes in the global configuration of the continents, the slow increase of solar luminosity that occur over hundreds of millions of years, variations in the Earth's orbit, and the injection of aerosols high into the atmosphere by explosive volcanic eruptions. Human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, the local emission and suspension of small (aerosol) particles on timescales of minutes to days, and changes in land use are some examples of anthropogenic forcings.  The global temperature variations reflected in ice core records from the distant past reflect the influence of natural external forcings on the climate system. However, these reconstructions of past temperature swings have also demonstrated that the projected rate of global temperature change exceeds anything seen in nature in the past 10,000 years.  Greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere are now higher than at any time in at least the last 750,000 years. It took at least 10,000 years from the end of the last ice age for levels of carbon dioxide to increase 100 ppmv to 280 ppmv, but that same increase has occurred over only the past 150 years to current values of over 370 ppmv. About half of that increase has occurred over the last 35 years, owing mainly to combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation. In the absence of controls, future projections are that the rate of increase in carbon dioxide amount may accelerate, and concentrations could double from pre-industrial values within the next 50 to 100 years.", 
  "GIGVJQXYPWCLMEC": "Global Climate Models perform calculations with timesteps of about 20 to 30 minutes so that they can capture the daily cycle and the progression of weather systems. As with weather forecasting models, the weather in a climate model is chaotic. Starting from a very similar (but not identical) state, a different simulation will ensue \u2013 with different weather, different storms, different wind patterns \u2013 i.e different wiggles. In control simulations, there are wiggles at almost all timescales \u2013 daily, monthly, yearly, decadally and longer \u2013 and modellers need to test very carefully how much of any change that happens because of a change in forcing is really associated with that forcing and how much might simply be due to the internal wiggles.", 
  "GQWCKFAOBVDZVDTCVVS": "This is a problem that people began talking about at least by the mid-20th century, when it was recognized that large eruptions produced caldera collapse, with the roof of a shallow magma chamber falling into the chamber as the magma erupted. Nearly all eruptions of 10 cubic kilometers or more involve the formation of large craters \u2014 calderas \u2014 by surface subsidence. Crater Lake in Oregon is a modest example, but these calderas can be up to 100 kilometers across with eruptions of 1,000 cubic kilometers or more of magma. The big ones, like in Yellowstone, have become popularly known as supervolcanoes.  The search for giant magma chambers that could feed supervolcanoes began in earnest in the 1980s in hopes of finding large sources of geothermal energy. One target of investigation was Long Valley Caldera in California, which had a super-eruption about 760,000 years ago and in the 1980s was undergoing \u201cunrest\u201d expressed by strong earthquakes and surface uplift approaching a meter. Scientists have since concluded that little or nothing remains of the huge magma body that must have once been present beneath this area.  Although success in prospecting for geothermal energy doesn\u2019t depend upon finding a huge magma body \u2014 dead but still hot magma will serve the purpose \u2014 it would be nice to know where the next super-eruption might occur. These eruptions are so rare however, perhaps one per 100,000 years on average, that they pose little risk to humans now.  Finding them is challenging and must be a multi\u00addisciplinary task. Volcanologists can determine where super-eruptions have occurred in the past, and how big and when. Geophysicists can, in principle, find magma as zones of slow seismic wave velocity and high electrical conductivity. Scientists can also detect, particularly from satellites with radar instruments, large areas of uplift or subsidence that might be due to movement of large magma bodies. Anomalous zones under many volcanoes, including Yellowstone, have been found that are best explained as containing some liquid rock \u2014 but perhaps only as the liquid part of a mostly crystalline slush \u2014 not what gets erupted as mostly liquid magma. Rock slush could also cause uplift and subsidence but so can other things like hydrothermal fluids. A huge, mostly liquid body of magma remains to be definitively located.  Why haven\u2019t we found one yet? There are several possibilities and the reasons are not mutually exclusive. We might not have looked in the right place yet. Maybe by looking where there were big eruptions in the past, we are looking at places where the magma chambers have completely emptied. Or maybe they develop very fast and quickly erupt. If so, at any given point in time they are rare, like a short-lived adult insect from a long-lived larva. Or maybe our indirect geophysical techniques aren\u2019t yet good enough. For example, scientists were recently quite surprised when they were drilling in a caldera in Iceland and encountered mostly liquid magma in a place where they expected a hydrothermal system at half the temperature; they were using state-of-the-art geophysics.  We may have some surprises coming, as we don\u2019t know exactly where these huge magma bodies are or what they are like. With more geothermal drilling going deeper and hotter, we may have more discoveries \u201cby accident.\u201d  It is often said that the Lake Toba eruption about 74,000 years ago, the most recent super-eruption, may have nearly wiped out our ancestors, leaving a small band of survivors comprising a sort of Adam and Eve. This, together with the prospect that it might happen again, is interesting to contemplate. Whenever unrest is reported at Yellowstone, the U.S. Geological Survey receives a flood of inquiries about whether doom is near. Of course it\u2019s possible, but so is another asteroid impact, all-out nuclear war, or the rise of a new pandemic-causing microbe, all of which pale before the risk of walking across the street. Danger, however unlikely, is fascinating.", 
  "GVAHYLVTSATWKJYYSKN": "Overall, volcanoes release about 5 percent of the equivalent amount of CO2 released by humans. Quite small. However, about once every 20 years there is a volcanic eruption (e.g., Mount Pinatubo, El Chichon) that throws out a tremendous amount of particles and other gases. These will effectively shield us enough from the sun to lead to a period of global cooling. The particles and gases typically dissipate after about 2 years, but the effect is nearly global.",

Perhaps the greatest fear is a collapse of food production, accompanied by escalating prices and mass starvation. It is unclear how likely this would be, since farmers are able to adjust their crops and farming techniques, to a degree, to adapt to climatic changes. But we have already seen heat waves contribute to broad crop failures. A decade ago, a big run-up in grain prices precipitated food riots around the world and led to the collapse of at least one government, in Haiti.  Another possibility would be a disintegration of the polar ice sheets, leading to fast-rising seas that would force people to abandon many of the world\u2019s great cities and would lead to the loss of trillions of dollars worth of property and other assets. In places like Florida and Virginia, towns are already starting to have trouble with coastal flooding.    Scientists also worry about other wild-card events. Will the Asian monsoons become less reliable, for instance? Billions of people depend on the monsoons to provide water for crops, so any disruptions could be catastrophic. Another possibility is a large-scale breakdown of the circulation patterns in the ocean, which could potentially lead to sudden, radical climate shifts across entire continents.",

More precipitation now falls as rain rather than snow in northern regions. Widespread increases in heavy precipitation events have been observed, even in places where total amounts have decreased. These changes are associated with increased water vapour in the atmosphere arising from the warming of the world\u2019s oceans, especially at lower latitudes.

Today, the world\u2019s oceans absorb more than 90% of the heat trapped by increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to human activities. This extra energy warms the ocean, causing it to expand. This in turn causes sea level to rise. Of the global rise in sea level observed over the last 35 years, about 40% is due to this warming of the water. Most of the rest is due to the melting of glaciers and ice sheets. Ocean levels are projected to rise another 1 to 4 feet over this century, with the precise number largely depending on the amount of global temperature rise and polar ice sheet melt.",

This will help minimize the consequences of climate change in the present and for future generations.  In addition, through adaptation and resiliency efforts, we can and must prepare an infrastructure built to withstand the impacts of global warming, protecting the lives of millions of people currently living in vulnerable areas.

  "HGUJOSSPEIVAAVYUOOW": "Surface temperature warming has occurred in all seasons and over much of the globe, but not uniformly. Climate models used to project future climate indicate that the largest temperature increases will occur over land relative to oceans, with the greatest warming at high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere during the winter and spring seasons - much like the pattern we have observed over recent decades.  Modest warming will have both positive and negative impacts. A modest increase in global temperatures could increase agricultural productivity in some areas by, for instance, lengthening the growing season. But in high latitude regions, where the warming is expected to be greatest, there is already strong evidence to suggest the current warming is having strong negative impacts, such as severe coastal erosion due to retreating sea ice, increasing sea level, and thawing of coastal permafrost. The thawing of tundra is having negative impacts on buildings, roads, and industry. Higher global sea levels associated with warmer ocean temperatures mean that storm surges associated with hurricanes will be more destructive.

However, the magnitude of these effects is not sufficient to explain changes in temperatures observed on Earth. Human disruption is simply the only current explanation we have that fits the data (Lean 2009).  Climate models are an important tool for studying all of the various influences on the Earth's climate. These models are constructed to include many different measurements that could affect temperature, including solar output, volcanic emissions, and the effects of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. When the effects of increasing levels of greenhouse gases are included in the models, as well as natural external factors, the models produce good simulations of the warming that has occurred over the past century.

These greenhouse gases are being emitted faster than forests and the oceans can remove them, causing them to build up in the atmosphere.  The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) has increased by more than 40% since pre-industrial times, and the current CO2 level is higher than it has been in at least 800,000 years.[1] We know that human activities are the cause of this increase because the CO2 emitted by burning fossil fuels carries a distinct chemical fingerprint that\u2019s detectable in the atmosphere.[2] Scientists have known since the 1800s that greenhouse gases trap heat, preventing it from escaping to space. The warming effect of greenhouse gases is amplified by feedbacks, especially from water vapor (a powerful and plentiful natural greenhouse gas), leading to more warming and changes in climate.[1] Natural influences on climate, such as changes in solar radiation, natural cycles, volcanic eruptions, and the climate\u2019s normal year-to-year variability, can\u2018t fully explain the current warming trend.[1] The climate changes observed in recent decades follow a number of patterns\u2014such as cooling at high altitudes and more warming at night than during the day\u2014that are consistent with what scientists would expect from an increase in greenhouse gases rather than changes in solar variability or other natural causes.[1]",

The precise amount of future climate change that will occur over the rest of this century is uncertain for several reasons.", 
  "IDEJGWKIANZQNXCJ": "While we can\u2019t stop climate change in its tracks, we can limit it to less dangerous levels by reducing our emissions. Even if all human-related emissions of carbon dioxide and the other heat-trapping gases were to stop today, Earth\u2019s temperature would continue to rise for a number of decades and then slowly begin to decline. However, focusing on short-lived types of emissions, such as methane and black carbon (soot), can reduce the rate of change in the near term. Because of the complex processes controlling carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, even after more than a thousand years, the global temperature would still be higher than it was in the pre-industrial period. As a result, without technological intervention, it will not be possible to totally reverse climate change. We do face a choice between a little more warming and lot more warming, however.

But these and other known problems have not been ignored; rather, steps have been taken to remove or minimize non-climate impacts on the long-term records. These steps are well documented and have been undertaken in a transparent way.[9] The non-climate artifacts have been identified and removed from station data records in cases where there is high confidence that it can be accomplished without harming the data quality. In cases where there is reason to believe that station data contain significant errors that cannot be corrected, those data are removed from national and global averages.  Although the possibility of unknown or uncorrected errors in the land surface temperature data cannot be completely excluded, many other lines of evidence confirm that our world has warmed over multiple decades:  Sea surface temperatures have increased.[2] Air temperatures aloft are increasing, according to weather balloons and satellites.[2] Birds are migrating earlier and their migration patterns are changing.[10] Plants are blooming earlier in the spring.[10] Fish species are migrating northward and toward cooler, deeper waters.[10] Overall, glaciers are melting and spring snow cover is declining in the Northern Hemisphere.[2] Greenland's ice sheet\u2014which holds about 8% of Earth's fresh water\u2014is melting at an accelerating rate.[2] Mean global sea level is rising.[2] Summertime Arctic sea ice is declining rapidly in both thickness and extent.[11]", 
  "IINWEGRXSGAVIAQGZ": "Raising livestock for food is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to manmade climate change. Forests have often been cut down and burned to obtain land for livestock production, which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and destroys a natural absorber of carbon. Livestock, especially cattle, produce methane through their digestion; this methane makes up one third of greenhouse gas emissions from the U.S. agricultural sector. Livestock manure also emits methane, in addition to nitrous oxide (another greenhouse gas); together, these make up another 14 percent of greenhouse gas emissions from the U.S. agricultural sector.  Economic development and population growth is leading to greater meat and dairy consumption worldwide, making livestock a rising contributor to climate change. Fortunately, there are ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from livestock operations, by capturing methane from manure and by changing animal feeding practices. Some experts also advocate consuming less meat and dairy.",

But when you average across the entire planet and over months or years, the temperature differences get far smaller \u2013 the variation at the surface of the Earth from one year to the next is measured in fractions of a degree. So a rise of 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the 19th century is actually high.  The substantial warming that has already occurred explains why much of the world\u2019s land ice is starting to melt and the oceans are rising at an accelerating pace. The heat accumulating in the Earth because of human emissions is roughly equal to the heat that would be released by 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs exploding across the planet every day.  Scientists believe most and probably all of the warming since 1950 was caused by the human release of greenhouse gases.

Climate 2030: A National Blueprint for a Clean Energy Economy (\u201cthe Blueprint\u201d) answers that need.  To help avoid the most dangerous consequences of climate change, ranging from extreme heat, droughts, and storms to acidifying oceans and rising sea levels, the United States must play a lead role and begin to cut its heat-trapping emissions today\u2014and aim for at least an 80 percent drop from 2005 levels by 2050. Blueprint policies lower U.S. heat-trapping emissions to meet a cap set at 26 percent below 2005 levels in 2020, and 56 percent below 2005 levels in 2030.  The nation achieves these deep cuts in carbon emissions while saving consumers and businesses $465 billion annually by 2030. The Blueprint also builds $1.7 trillion in net cumulative savings between 2010 and 2030. Blueprint policies stimulate significant consumer, business, and government investment in new technologies and measures by 2030. The resulting savings on energy bills from reductions in electricity and fuel use more than offset the costs of these additional investments. The result is net annual savings for households, vehicle owners, businesses, and industries of $255 billion by 2030.  Under the Blueprint, every region of the country stands to save billions. Households and businesses\u2014even in coal-dependent regions\u2014will share in these savings.", 
  "JOYOMVTWAQTZOXT": "Sea water absorbs 30 to 40 percent of the carbon dioxide released by humans, which changes the ocean's chemical composition and disrupts marine ecosystems. This change in chemical composition is referred to as ocean acidification, although the ocean will not actually become acid-like. Rather, its pH value is changing from slightly basic to more neutral. But such a seemingly small change is enough to affect many creatures. For example, acidification prevents the shells of shellfish form forming.", 
  "JPXFKZDBRHDPMGOKDGK": "Predicting how climate will change in future decades is a different scientific issue from predicting weather a few weeks from now. Weather is short term and chaotic, largely determined by whatever atmospheric system is moving through at the time, and thus it is increasingly difficult to predict day-to-day changes beyond about two weeks into the future. Climate, on the other hand, is a long-term statistical average of weather and is determined by larger-scale forces, such as the level of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere and the energy coming from the sun. Thus it is actually easier to project how climate will change in the future. By analogy, while it is impossible to predict the age of death of any individual, the average age of death of an American can be calculated. In this case, weather is like the individual, while climate is like the average. To extend this analogy into the realm of climate change, we can also calculate the life expectancy of the average American who smokes. We can predict that on average, a smoker will not live as long as a non-smoker. Similarly, we can project what the climate will be like if we emit less heat-trapping gas, and what it will be like if we emit more", 
  "JRYULBBLCFKAUGG": "With continued increases in heat-trapping gas emissions, particularly that of carbon dioxide, climate change projections include changes in average temperatures, precipitation patterns, drought occurrences, and the frequency of extreme events. These changes can be a threat to humans as noted above in answers to previous questions. The distribution of these changes around the globe will not be uniform so some areas will experience more changes than others. Societies, governments, and individuals can take steps to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to shifting climate and weather events in their homes, communities, and businesses. From infrastructure upgrades to better management of natural resources (like lands, coastal ecosystems, and freshwater reservoirs), to better preparedness and communications when extreme events do occur \u2014 people can make human structures and systems more resilient to projected climate-related impacts. Over time, these and other adaptation measures will save lives, money, and valuable resources.  Additional climate choices are summarized in two 2010 reports by the National Academy of Sciences, titled Informing an Effective Response to Climate Change and Adapting to the Impacts of Climate Change.", 
  "JVWZSEGTUPMAMRVYZKR": "Today's global warming is different from previous warming periods in two key ways: the reason and the rate. Today, the reason Earth is warming is mainly due to the increase in heat-trapping gases that humans are adding to the atmosphere. And our world is warming at a much faster rate today than it did in the interglacial warm periods over the last million years. The transition from the last ice age to the current interglacial period is estimated to have spanned 5,000 years.[14] Humans could witness the same magnitude of global warming within a span of about 110 years. In other words, if our world warms by as much as 7\u00b0F (4.1\u00b0C) from 1990 to 2100, as some climate models project could happen, then that warming rate is about 45 times faster than the warming Earth experienced when it emerged from the last ice age", 
  "JWJOEFTQQHVGCEBL": "Many chemical compounds present in Earth's atmosphere behave as 'greenhouse gases'. These are gases which allow direct sunlight (relative shortwave energy) to reach the Earth's surface unimpeded. As the shortwave energy (that in the visible and ultraviolet portion of the spectra) heats the surface, longer-wave (infrared) energy (heat) is reradiated to the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases absorb this energy, thereby allowing less heat to escape back to space, and 'trapping' it in the lower atmosphere. Many greenhouse gases occur naturally in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and nitrous oxide, while others are synthetic. Those that are man-made include the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and Perfluorocarbons (PFCs), as well as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Atmospheric concentrations of both the natural and man-made gases have been rising over the last few centuries due to the industrial revolution. As the global population has increased and our reliance on fossil fuels (such as coal, oil and natural gas) has been firmly solidified, so emissions of these gases have risen. While gases such as carbon dioxide occur naturally in the atmosphere, through our interference with the carbon cycle (through burning forest lands, or mining and burning coal), we artificially move carbon from solid storage to its gaseous state, thereby increasing atmospheric concentrations.", 
  "JXNUWYNDREQPGHE": "Before the industrial revolution, the CO2 content in the air remained quite steady for thousands of years. Natural CO2 is not static, however. It is generated by natural processes, and absorbed by others.  As you can see in Figure 1, natural land and ocean carbon remains roughly in balance and have done so for a long time \u2013 and we know this because we can measure historic levels of CO2 in the atmosphere both directly (in ice cores) and indirectly (through proxies).  But consider what happens when more CO2 is released from outside of the natural carbon cycle \u2013 by burning fossil fuels. Although our output of 29 gigatons of CO2 is tiny compared to the 750 gigatons moving through the carbon cycle each year, it adds up because the land and ocean cannot absorb all of the extra CO2. About 40% of this additional CO2 is absorbed. The rest remains in the atmosphere, and as a consequence, atmospheric CO2 is at its highest level in 15 to 20 million years (Tripati 2009). (A natural change of 100ppm normally takes 5,000 to 20,000 years. The recent increase of 100ppm has taken just 120 years).  Human CO2 emissions upset the natural balance of the carbon cycle. Man-made CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by a third since the pre-industrial era, creating an artificial forcing of global temperatures which is warming the planet. While fossil-fuel derived CO2 is a very small component of the global carbon cycle, the extra CO2 is cumulative because the natural carbon exchange cannot absorb all the additional CO2.", 
  "KCJNATEWARPDJXFAV": "Yes. There have been a number of studies that have examined the U.S. and global temperature records in great detail. These have used a variety of methods to study the effects of changes in instruments, time of observations, station siting, and other potential sources of error. All studies reinforce high confidence in the reality of the observed upward trends in temperature.", 
  "KDZLTTQNXSIASFZR": "Initially (ca. 1975), GCMs were based purely on atmospheric processes \u2013 the winds, radiation, and with simplified clouds. By the mid-1980s, there were simple treatments of the upper ocean and sea ice, and clouds parameterisations started to get slightly more sophisticated. In the 1990s, fully coupled ocean-atmosphere models started to become available. This is when the first Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) was started. This has subsequently seen two further iterations, the latest (CMIP3) being the database used in support of much of the model work in the IPCC AR4. Over that time, model simulations have become demonstrably more realistic (Reichler and Kim, 2008) as resolution has increased and parameterisations have become more sophisticated. Nowadays, models also include dynamic sea ice, aerosols and atmospheric chemistry modules. Issues like excessive \u2018climate drift\u2019 (the tendency for a coupled model to move away from the a state resembling the actual climate) which were problematic in the early days are now much minimised.", 
  "KEPHYOGZVBKYKUWA": "No. While models contain a lot of physics, they don\u2019t contain many small-scale processes that more specialised groups (of atmospheric chemists, or coastal oceanographers for instance) might worry about a lot. Mostly this is a question of scale (model grid boxes are too large for the details to be resolved), but sometimes it\u2019s a matter of being uncertain how to include it (for instance, the impact of ocean eddies on tracers).  Additionally, many important bio-physical-chemical cycles (for the carbon fluxes, aerosols, ozone) are only just starting to be incorporated. Ice sheet and vegetation components are very much still under development.", 
  "KKJHHFDHCVCSUQOX": "An extreme event is a time and place in which weather, climate, or environmental conditions \u2014 such as temperature, precipitation, drought, or flooding \u2014 rank above a threshold value near the upper or lower ends of the range of historical measurements.[29] Though the threshold is arbitrary, some scientists define extreme events as those that occur in the highest or lowest 5% or 10% of historical measurements.[30]  Human-caused climate change is not the sole cause of any single extreme event. However, changes in the intensity or frequency of extremes may be influenced by human-caused climate change.[27, 28] Heat waves will tend to be a bit hotter\u2014 both the daily high and daily low temperatures. And, because a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor, precipitation events will tend to be heavier (as measured by total rainfall or snowfall). These are just two examples of how extreme events are becoming more extreme.  Establishing causes of a specific extreme event can be difficult and requires case-specific methods. Scientists can assess whether a specific event (e.g., the 2012 U.S. drought, or the storm surge from Superstorm Sandy) has become more or less likely, or stronger or weaker, as a consequence of human-caused climate change. In nineteen recent analyses of twelve extreme events in 2012, scientists found that some events had direct ties to climate change, while others did not.[31] For more details, see Climate.gov's Q&A with Thomas Peterson, lead editor of the report.", 
  "KNVGUVIWCLRPPJAKX": "No, the globe did not stop warming after 1998. While 1998 was one of the ten warmest years on record, the other nine warmest years have all occurred after 1998.[2]  It's important to remember that, even during global warming periods, every year won't be warmer than the year before, and there may even be several years in a row of cooler average temperatures. That's why it's more reliable to look at changes between 5-year and 10-year blocks of time over a span of decades before drawing conclusions about climate sensitivity.  It's true that humans have released more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from 1998 to 2012 than in any other 15-year period in history, and it's true there was a slowdown in the rate of global warming during that time. Most of the excess heat (>80%) from global warming has been going into the ocean.[17] The point is global warming didn't stop over the last decade; most of the warming happened in the ocean rather than in the lower atmosphere.  Scientists are always reassessing their estimates of climate sensitivity based on observed changes in temperature and ocean heat content. It's too early to conclude that the climate system isn't as sensitive to carbon dioxide as scientists thought, though that possibility is being actively researched. Stay tuned...!", 
  "KOMNAPVSMTRELPUEDV": "Major developments in climate change science have been reported since the publication of the comprehensive 2007 Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).[1]  Recent publications indicate that the consequences of climate change are already occurring at a faster pace and are of greater magnitude than the climate models used by the IPCC projected. A few of the most compelling findings are summarized below.  More CO2 Remains in the Atmosphere Human activities have pumped excessive amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. Natural processes that absorb CO2 cannot keep up. As the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide, it becomes more acidic. This combined with increasing ocean temperatures, diminishes its ability to continue absorbing CO2. As a result, more CO2 stays in the atmosphere. In 1960, a metric ton (1,000 kilograms; ~2,205 pounds) of CO2 emissions resulted in around 400 kilograms (~881 pounds) of CO2 remaining in the atmosphere (Figure 1). In 2006, a metric ton of CO2 emissions results in around 450 kilograms (~992 pounds) remaining in the atmosphere.[2] Hence a ton of CO2 emissions today results in more heat-trapping capacity in the atmosphere than the same ton emitted decades ago.", 
  "KOYXMZLAOKWFBHHI": "It's important to recognize that weather and climate are related but they are different things. Daily temperature swings of tens of degrees at a given location are common weather-driven events. But when measurements of the daily high and low temperatures in many thousands of locations all over the world\u2014on land and ocean\u2014are examined for an entire year and then averaged together, the Earth's annual average temperatures from year to year are found to be very stable when the climate isn't changing. In a geological context, a 1.5\u00b0F (0.85\u00b0C) warming over a span of 100 years is an unusually large temperature change in a relatively short span of time and indicates that the climate is changing. This warming is important because it increases the probabilities of extreme weather and climate events.[12]  If global warming were to stop now, its most potentially serious problems would be prevented. However, global warming is expected to continue at an increasing rate. In several decades our world is likely to become warmer than it's been for over a million years, with unpredictable consequences. It's also important to recognize that Earth is not warming uniformly, nor is it expected to. Middle and high latitudes in general change more than the tropics, and land surface temperatures change more than ocean temperatures. Over the long term, land masses at the latitude of the United States are expected to warm much more than the global average.", 
  "KSQSBFCOZYRQSAWJSMY": "The factors that make up climate (such as temperature and precipitation) have been measured directly since the 1860's. However to understand what climate was like before this, scientists have to use 'proxies', or indirect measurements that have a well-defined relationship to temperature or other climatic variables. Some common proxies include:  Ice cores - The ratio of oxygen isotopes in the ice can indicate the temperature at the time the ice was formed. Air bubbles trapped in ice can show what the greenhouse gas concentration of the atmosphere was at the time of formation. Ocean sediment cores - The remains of small hard-shelled creatures (foramnifera) are preserved in ocean sediments. The composition of their shells can reveal ocean temperatures at the time of their formation. Pollen records - Fossilized pollen grains can indicate what types of plants were present at the time the fossils were formed. Tree rings - The width of annual tree rings in temperate climates depend in part on soil moisture and temperature, and can therefore reveal information about these variables. Past climate is often 'reconstructed' by looking at many of these measurements together", 
  "KSZBMQZYWLFZNWP": "The episodic nature of the Earth's glacial and interglacial periods within the present Ice Age (the last couple of million years) have been caused primarily by cyclical changes in the Earth's circumnavigation of the Sun. Variations in the Earth's eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession comprise the three dominant cycles, collectively known as the Milankovitch Cycles for Milutin Milankovitch, the Serbian astronomer and mathematician who is generally credited with calculating their magnitude. Taken in unison, variations in these three cycles creates alterations in the seasonality of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface. These times of increased or decreased solar radiation directly influence the Earth's climate system, thus impacting the advance and retreat of Earth's glaciers.  It is of primary importance to explain that climate change, and subsequent periods of glaciation, resulting from the following three variables is not due to the total amount of solar energy reaching Earth. The three Milankovitch Cycles impact the seasonality and location of solar energy around the Earth, thus impacting contrasts between the seasons.", 
  "KTMTCNZFBWUYWFFFQEB": "Since 1950, the number of heat waves has increased and widespread increases have occurred in the numbers of warm nights. The extent of regions affected by droughts has also increased as precipitation over land has marginally decreased while evaporation has increased due to warmer conditions. Generally, numbers of heavy daily precipitation events that lead to flooding have increased, but not everywhere. Tropical storm and hurricane frequencies vary considerably from year to year, but evidence suggests substantial increases in intensity and duration since the 1970s. In the extratropics, variations in tracks and intensity of storms reflect variations in major features of the atmospheric circulation, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation. ", 
  "KTWHOUSRPLTGFIFT": "Rising global temperatures exacerbate heat-related diseases such as heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and cardiovascular, respiratory, and kidney diseases. On average, extreme heat kills more Americans every year than floods, hurricanes, lightning, and tornadoes taken together.  Climate change also has a strong impact on food-borne and water-borne diseases, which thrive in warmer, wetter conditions, as well as diseases carried by insects, snails, and other cold-blooded animals, whose ranges are extended by climactic shifts. As the world becomes warmer and wetter due to climate change, diseases that thrive in these conditions (such as malaria) will spread, sickening and killing more people each year.",

There are many technologies already available, and actions we can take today, that will help us reduce our risks. Many of the actions that we can take to address climate change will have immediate benefits, such as cleaner, healthier air, as well as significant future climate benefits. A recent EPA study found that global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could avoid tens of thousands of deaths annually in the U.S. by the end of the century and avoid billions of dollars in damages related to water shortages, agricultural losses, flooding, and other impacts.", 
  "LLHNCRATYTEMWJGA": "Many people imagine the ocean to be like a bathtub, where the water level is consistent all the way around. In fact, the sea is rather lumpy \u2014 strong winds and other factors can cause water to pile up in some spots, and to be lower in others.  Also, the huge ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica exert a gravitational pull on the sea, drawing water toward them. As they melt, sea levels in their vicinity will fall as the water gets redistributed to distant areas.  How the rising ocean affects particular parts of the world will therefore depend on which ice sheet melts fastest, how winds and currents shift, and other related factors. On top of all that, some coastal areas are sinking as the sea rises, so they get a double whammy.", 
  "LOUACWRKYGMSDQP": "Ice cores are scientists\u2019 best source for historical climate data. Every winter, some snow coating Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets is left behind and compressed into a layer of ice. By extracting cylinders of ice from sheets thousands of meters thick, scientists can analyze dust, ash, pollen and bubbles of atmospheric gas trapped inside. The deepest discovered ice cores are an estimated 800,000 years old. The particles trapped inside give scientists clues about volcanic eruptions, desert extent and forest fires. The presence of certain ions indicates past ocean activity, levels of sea ice and even the intensity of the sun. The bubbles can be released to reveal the make-up of the ancient atmosphere, including greenhouse gas levels.  Other tools for learning about Earth\u2019s ancient atmosphere include growth rings in trees, which keep a rough record of each growing season\u2019s temperature, moisture and cloudiness going back about 2,000 years. Corals also form growth rings that provide information about temperature and nutrients in the tropical ocean.", 
  "LWQBGWTUNHKMKZZWUYN": "Harmful climate-related impacts are being observed in the United States and around the world.[13,14] The combination of warming temperatures and melting ice sheets and glaciers is causing global sea level to rise, which presents a growing threat to vital coastal ecosystems and millions of people around the world who live in coastal regions. This threat includes both the gradual upward creep of sea level and periodic, catastrophic ocean surges associated with land-falling cyclones.  An overall shift toward more extreme and longer-lasting heat waves has been observed.[12] The year 2012 saw thousands of temperature records broken all over the United States, and it was by far the U.S.'s warmest year on record. But it's not just the daily high temperatures that are a concern. The average daily low temperatures have been rising at an even faster rate than the average daily highs. Doctors and farmers alike have observed that heat stress occurs in people, livestock, and crops when the temperature doesn't cool down enough overnight. As a result, productivity in people, plants, and animals declines which, in turn, hurts our quality of life and economy.  A warmer atmosphere has a greater capacity to hold water vapor. Consequently, climate models project that global warming will tend to cause wet regions to get wetter and dry regions to get drier. In the east and northeastern United States, an increase has been observed in very heavy downpours of rain leading to flash flooding, loss of life, and damages to property and infrastructure. Climate models suggest floods and water quality problems are likely to be amplified by climate change in most \"wet\" regions.[13] According to the IPCC (SREX Report), \"there is medium confidence (based on physical reasoning) that projected increases in heavy rainfall would contribute to increases in local flooding in some catchments or regions.\"  At the same time, \"dry\" regions are getting drier. Large areas in the west and southwest U.S. have experienced abnormally dry to exceptional drought conditions that stress water resources and present challenges to farmers, ranchers, water resource managers, and energy utilities.[13] These water deficits appear to be part of a long-term trend toward drier conditions in the west and southwest. Internationally, more intense and longer lasting droughts over wider areas could cause global food shortages and political unrest, contributing to mass starvation and armed conflicts.", 
  "MAIHQGFKPCCCNSVCVZ": "Yes, there is strong evidence that global sea level gradually rose in the 20th century and is currently rising at an increased rate, after a period of little change between AD 0 and AD 1900. Sea level is projected to rise at an even greater rate in this century. The two major causes of global sea level rise are thermal expansion of the oceans (water expands as it warms) and the loss of land-based ice due to increased melting", 
  "MBZAZDVPKKDEMJWKQ": "The risks are much greater over the long run than over the next few decades, but the emissions that create those risks are happening now. This means the current generation of people is dooming future generations to a more difficult future.   How difficult?  Over the coming 25 or 30 years, scientists say, the climate is likely to resemble that of today, although gradually getting warmer, with more of the extreme heat waves that can kill vulnerable people. Rainfall will be heavier in many parts of the world, but the periods between rains will most likely grow hotter and drier. The number of hurricanes and typhoons may actually fall, but the ones that do occur will draw energy from a hotter ocean surface, and therefore may be more intense. Coastal flooding will grow more frequent and damaging, as is already happening.  Longer term, if emissions continue to rise unchecked, the risks are profound. Scientists fear climate effects so severe that they might destabilize governments, produce waves of refugees, precipitate the sixth mass extinction of plants and animals in the Earth\u2019s history, and melt the polar ice caps, causing the seas to rise high enough to flood most of the world\u2019s coastal cities.  All of this could take hundreds or even thousands of years to play out, but experts cannot rule out abrupt changes, such as a collapse of agriculture, that would throw civilization into chaos much sooner. Bolder efforts to limit emissions would reduce these risks, or at least slow the effects, but it is already too late to eliminate the risks entirely.", 
  "MCAATQYBJQFZQEIG": "Yes.

  "MNGEJBKRTECFLPY": "Global warming is an ongoing, gradual process that does not prevent cold, snowy weather from occurring. Instead, global warming makes colder-than-average winters less likely, and warmer-than-average winters more likely. Local weather patterns can be misleading: a cold winter in the Northeast United States can be the exception to an abnormally warm winter in the rest of the northern hemisphere. Over time, scientists expect winters to become shorter as global temperatures continue to rise. We have already seen shifts in growing seasons.  Some studies actually suggest that colder-than-average winters can be attributed to climate change. As the climate warms, more water vapor enters the atmosphere, intensifying rain and snowstorms and creating a more humid\u2014and thereby colder and snowier\u2014winter.", 
  "MQWZKESARAJLCVF": "Many places already experience weather extremes such as heatwaves, droughts, fire, floods, storm surges and cyclones, all with damaging consequences. Many of the negative impacts of climate change will occur through changes in the magnitude, duration and frequency of these extreme events.  To adapt to these changes and manage the risks, more detailed information is needed on local and regional scales. It is important to recognise that 2\u2103 of globally averaged warming does not imply 2\u2103 everywhere (many regions, particularly on land, will have larger temperature rises). Extremes may increase faster than averages.  We also need to understand the short-term (decades) and long-term (centuries) implications of choices made today.",

Prior to 1880, temperature measurements were made with instruments like thermometers. The oldest continuous temperature record is the Central England Temperature Data Series, which began in 1659, and the Hadley Centre has some measurements beginning in 1850, but there are too few data before 1880 for scientists to estimate average temperatures for the entire planet. Data from earlier years is reconstructed from proxy records like tree rings, pollen counts and ice cores. Because these are different kinds of data, scientists generally don\u2019t put proxy-based estimates on the same charts as the \u201cinstrumental record.\u201d  The above-mentioned agencies and others collect temperature data from thousands of weather stations worldwide, including over the ocean, in Antarctica and from satellites. However, instruments are not perfectly distributed around the globe, and some measurement sites have been deforested or urbanized since 1880, affecting temperatures nearby. Each agency uses algorithms to filter the effects of these changes out of the temperature record and interpolate where data is sparse, like over the vast southern ocean, when calculating global averages. Generally, all three datasets agree quite closely (see graph above) and are in agreement on the trend of global warming since the Industrial Revolution. ", 
  "MWITGQPVXPFRSHULLQ": "No. There are often large variation in the temperature and precipitation statistics over short distances because the local climatic characteristics are affected by the local geography. The GCMs are designed to describe the most important large-scale features of the climate, such as the energy flow, the circulation, and the temperature in a grid-box volume (through physical laws of thermodynamics, the dynamics, and the ideal gas laws). A typical grid-box may have a horizontal area of ~100\u00d7100 km2, but the size has tended to reduce over the years as computers have increased in speed. The shape of the landscape (the details of mountains, coastline etc.) used in the models reflect the spatial resolution, hence the model will not have sufficient detail to describe local climate variation associated with local geographical features (e.g. mountains, valleys, lakes, etc.). However, it is possible to use a GCM to derive some information about the local climate through downscaling, as it is affected by both the local geography (a more or less given constant) as well as the large-scale atmospheric conditions. The results derived through downscaling can then be compared with local climate variables, and can be used for further (and more severe) assessments of the combination model-downscaling technique. This is however still an experimental technique.", 
  "MYOSAOXIXEUEHUS": "As human-induced emissions of carbon dioxide build up in the atmosphere, excess carbon dioxide dissolves into the oceans, where it reacts with seawater to form carbonic acid, which makes ocean waters more acidic and corrosive.

  "NAYIDXFMFKRQFAOU": "Major climate research organizations worldwide have developed mathematically rigorous, peer-reviewed data processing methods to identify and compensate for changes in observing conditions. Since the research groups are independent, they do not use exactly the same techniques.

NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) addresses this problem using satellite images of nighttime lights to classify stations as urban, near-urban or rural, then compares the urbanized records with an average of nearby rural stations to calculate the extent by which urbanization has warmed the data. NCDC, in processing station data for its U.S. climate divisional dataset (nClimDiv) and Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN), corrects for the urban heat island effect and other changes such as station moves by using a technique that compares each station with multiple neighboring stations to find \"guilty\" stations and calculate the magnitude of necessary corrections.", 
  "NCORBLVPFAWRXQEMN": "This question has been around for decades and it requires truly interdisciplinary efforts to answer.  The major ecosystems of the planet are critically important for humans and for all creatures, and they are currently subject to very strong pressure from climate change and from human-induced ecological disturbances, such as agriculture and invasive species. Ecosystems change both slowly and abruptly in apparent response to extreme events that may be embedded in long-term change. Ecosystems have strong feedback effects on the atmospheric budgets of heat, moisture, greenhouse gases and aerosols, and, therefore, on climate.  To find out how climate change will affect forests and dry-land vegetation, and how those changes will affect atmospheric composition, we need more observations. Observations need to be on timescales of decades or longer to reflect processes in the atmosphere and of the major ecosystems. They also need to span local, regional and global spatial scales. Finally, we need ecosystem models integrated with atmospheric models that work like real systems.  In the United States, there are efforts to study parts of this problem and to make the requisite observations, supported by the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, NASA, the U.S. Forest Service and NOAA. What remains to be done is to coordinate and invigorate these efforts, and to commit to solving the problem on the relevant time and space scales. We have certainly seen a lot of progress in the last few years, but it has mostly served to point to the serious the gaps in our knowledge.

  "NHCVQEZAASFQBBFCRG": "Climate has changed on all time scales throughout Earth\u2019s history. Some aspects of the current climate change are not unusual, but others are. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has reached a record high relative to more than the past half-million years, and has done so at an exceptionally fast rate. Current global temperatures are warmer than they have ever been during at least the past five centuries, probably even for more than a millennium. If warming continues unabated, the resulting climate change within this century would be extremely unusual in geological terms. Another unusual aspect of recent climate change is its cause: past climate changes were natural in origin (see FAQ 6.1), whereas most of the warming of the past 50 years is attributable to human activities.", 
  "NHLZQIYQMCFJMQC": "Countries with huge, frozen hinterlands, including Canada and Russia, could see some economic benefits as global warming makes agriculture, mining and the like more possible in those places. It is perhaps no accident that the Russians have always been reluctant to make ambitious climate commitments, and President Vladimir V. Putin has publicly questioned the science of climate change.  However, both of those countries could suffer enormous damage to their natural resources; escalating fires in Russia are already killing millions of acres of forests per year. Moreover, some experts believe countries that view themselves as likely winners from global warming will come to see the matter differently once they are swamped by millions of refugees from less fortunate lands.",

  "NMEJDCZEWMWFRVQQM": "Scientists have been warning since the 1980s that strong policies were needed to limit emissions. Those warnings were ignored, and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were allowed to build up to potentially dangerous levels. So the hour is late.  But after 20 years of largely fruitless diplomacy, the governments of the world are finally starting to take the problem seriously. A deal reached in Paris in late 2015 commits nearly every country to some kind of action. President Trump decided in 2017 to pull the United States out of that deal, saying it would unfairly burden American businesses. But other countries are promising to go forward with it anyway, and some states and cities have defied Mr. Trump by adopting more ambitious climate goals.  Religious leaders like Pope Francis are speaking out. Low-emission technologies, such as electric cars, are improving. Leading corporations are making bold promises to switch to renewable power and stop forest destruction.  What is still largely missing in all this are the voices of ordinary citizens. Because politicians have a hard time thinking beyond the next election, they tend to tackle hard problems only when the public rises up and demands it.", 
  "NPHWIUPKOUSBWZDHXJ": "You can reduce your own carbon footprint in lots of simple ways, and most of them will save you money. You can plug leaks in your home insulation to save power, install a smart thermostat, switch to more efficient light bulbs, turn off the lights in any room where you are not using them, drive fewer miles by consolidating trips or taking public transit, waste less food and eat less meat.  Perhaps the biggest single thing individuals can do on their own is to take fewer airplane trips; just one or two fewer plane rides per year can save as much in emissions as all the other actions combined. If you want to be at the cutting edge, you can look at buying an electric or hybrid car, putting solar panels on your roof, or both.  If you want to offset your emissions, you can buy certificates, with the money going to projects that protect forests, capture greenhouse gases and so forth. Some airlines sell these to offset emissions from their flights. You can also buy offset certificates in a private marketplace, from companies such as TerraPass; some people even give these as holiday gifts. In states that allow you to choose your own electricity supplier, you can often elect to buy green electricity; you pay slightly more, and the money goes into a fund that helps finance projects like wind farms.  Leading companies are also starting to demand clean energy for their operations. You can pay attention to company policies, patronize the leaders, and let the others know you expect them to do better.  In the end, though, experts do not believe the needed transformation in the energy system can happen without strong state and national policies. So speaking up and exercising your rights as a citizen matters as much as anything else you can do.", 
  "NRAFIDXLCMUOOQTER": "Global warming is primarily a problem of too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  This carbon overload is caused mainly when we burn fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas or cut down and burn forests. There are many heat-trapping gases (from methane to water vapor), but CO2 puts us at the greatest risk of irreversible changes if it continues to accumulate unabated in the atmosphere. There are two key reasons why.  CO2 has caused most of the warming and its influence is expected to continue. CO2, more than any other climate driver, has contributed the most to climate change between 1750 and 2005.[1, 2, 3] The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a global climate assessment in 2007 that compared the relative influence exerted by key heat-trapping gases, tiny particles known as aerosols, and land use change of human origin on our climate between 1750 and 2005.[3] By measuring the abundance of heat-trapping gases in ice cores, the atmosphere, and other climate drivers along with models, the IPCC calculated the \u201cradiative forcing\u201d (RF) of each climate driver\u2014in other words, the net increase (or decrease) in the amount of energy reaching Earth\u2019s surface attributable to that climate driver. Positive RF values represent average surface warming and negative values represent average surface cooling. CO2 has the highest positive RF (see Figure 1) of all the human-influenced climate drivers compared by the IPCC. Other gases have more potent heat-trapping ability molecule per molecule than CO2 (e.g. methane), but are simply far less abundant in the atmosphere and being added more slowly.", 
  "NUHGKNADEQHNHTUZKLW": "Yes; the type, frequency and intensity of extreme events are expected to change as Earth\u2019s climate changes, and these changes could occur even with relatively small mean climate changes. Changes in some types of extreme events have already been observed, for example, increases in the frequency and intensity of heat waves and heavy precipitation events.", 
  "OBCYHDNJLIVUBJDDCRZ": "Climate refers to the average meteorological conditions and patterns in a region over a long time period. These meteorological conditions include measurements such as temperature, precipitation, and wind.  In other words, climate can be described as the 'average weather'. Although weather can change rapidly from day to day and can be difficult to predict, climate is much more predictable. For example, the weather where we live dictates what we wear each day, which can change dramatically from one day to the next. However, the climate influences the type of clothes we have in our closet, which is generally consistent from year to year.", 
  "OCNEDRNFFNSWDOLBA": "It can go either way. Almost half of NOAA's corrected data are cooler than the original records. NOAA's corrections of temperatures over the oceans \u2014 done to compensate for changes in methods of observing the temperature of water at the surface of the ocean \u2014 reduced the warming trend in global temperature.", 
  "OHFDKICNQTQYOZJVGBZ": "Climate varies from region to region. This variation is driven by the uneven distribution of solar heating, the individual responses of the atmosphere, oceans and land surface, the interactions between these, and the physical characteristics of the regions. The perturbations of the atmospheric constituents that lead to global changes affect certain aspects of these complex interactions. Some human-induced factors that affect climate (\u2018forcings\u2019) are global in nature, while others differ from one region to another. For example, carbon dioxide, which causes warming, is distributed evenly around the globe, regardless of where the emissions originate, whereas sulphate aerosols (small particles) that offset some of the warming tend to be regional in their distribution. Furthermore, the response to forcings is partly governed by feedback processes that may operate in different regions from those in which the forcing is greatest. Thus, the projected changes in climate will also vary from region to region.", 
  "ORJNKRBTDLCAPLVDAPB": " Albedo is the reflectance of a surface, such as the earth's surface. Different earth land covers have very different albedo; for example, ice and snow are highly reflective (high albedo) while darker surfaces like vegetation do not reflect as much radiation (low albedo). Albedo plays an important role in global temperature change, since absorbed solar radiation warms the Earth's surface, whereas reflected radiation does not.  Feedback is a general term that encompasses all of the different forms of energy exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere. In the context of global warming, positive feedbacks enhance land surface warming; negative feedbacks enhance land surface cooling.  Albedo is one component of this energy feedback. Since different land covers have varied albedo, land use change can influence albedo and whether a land surface has a warming or cooling effect. As mentioned, snow has a very high albedo because it reflects more sunlight, and thus has a cooling effect on global temperatures (negative feedback). However, if snow melts and is replaced by darker vegetation, more sunlight is absorbed, which will add to a warming effect (positive feedback - IPCC 2007).  An emerging topic of interest related to albedo and feedback is the deposition of black carbon. Black carbon is a component of air pollution and is produced by combustion. It absorbs solar radiation and can greatly lower surface albedo if deposited on snow or ice. Black carbon is now thought to have played a major role in warming in the arctic, mainly by changing albedo and causing a positive warming feedback (Shindell & Faluvegi, 2009).", 
  "OSWMDQCDRSJWMTGYJ": "Climate change endangers our health by affecting our food and water sources, the air we breathe, the weather we experience, and our interactions with the built and natural environments. As the climate continues to change, the risks to human health continue to grow. Although every American is vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change, some populations are disproportionately vulnerable, including those with low income, some communities of color, immigrant groups (including those with limited English proficiency), Indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational groups, persons with disabilities, and persons with preexisting or chronic medical conditions", 
  "OUGOQMVFCZMWTHEJ": "Changes in climate extremes are expected as the climate warms in response to increasing atmospheric greenhouse gases resulting from human activities, such as the use of fossil fuels. However, determining whether a specific, single extreme event is due to a specific cause, such as increasing greenhouse gases, is difficult, if not impossible, for two reasons: 1) extreme events are usually caused by a combination of factors and 2) a wide range of extreme events is a normal occurrence even in an unchanging climate. Nevertheless, analysis of the warming observed over the past century suggests that the likelihood of some extreme events, such as heat waves, has increased due to greenhouse warming, and that the likelihood of others, such as frost or extremely cold nights, has decreased. For example, a recent study estimates that human influences have more than doubled the risk of a very hot European summer like that of 2003. ", 
  "OVFLEPSFMCQZYBQP": "Climate is projected to continue to warm, with the amount of future warming ranging from another 3\u00baF to another 12\u00baF by 2100, depending primarily on the level of emissions from human activities, principally the burning of fossil fuels. For precipitation, wet areas are generally projected to get wetter while dry areas get drier. More precipitation is expected to fall in heavy downpours. Natural variability will still play a role in year-to-year changes.", 
  "OVGXTIGBSUGVPLROXXV": "The most direct way to significantly reduce the magnitude of future climate change is to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases. Emissions can be reduced in many ways, and increasing the efficiency of energy use is an important component of many potential strategies. For example, because about 28% of the energy used in the U.S. is used for transportation, developing and driving more efficient vehicles and changing to fuels that do not contribute significantly to heat-trapping gas emissions over their lifetimes would result in fewer emissions per mile driven. A large amount of energy in the U.S. is also used to heat and cool buildings, so changes in building design could dramatically reduce energy use. While there is no single silver bullet that will solve all the challenges posed by climate change, there are many options that can reduce our emissions and help prevent some of the potentially serious impacts of climate change. There will be some costs to these changes, but even very ambitious emissions reductions targets have relatively small costs over the decades it will take to implement them.", 
  "OWVVJLVIGTMMTNIHACP": "Yes and no. The ozone hole is basically a man-made hole in the ozone layer above the South Pole during the Southern Hemisphere\u2019s spring. The ozone layer, which lies high up in the atmosphere, shields us from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays that come from the sun. Unfortunately we punched a hole in it, through the use of gases like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in spray cans and refrigerants, which break down ozone molecules in the upper atmosphere. While some of the sun\u2019s UV rays slip through the hole, they account for less than one percent of the sun\u2019s energy. So these UV rays cannot explain the global warming of the planet.  What scientists have uncovered recently, however, is that the ozone hole has been affecting climate in the Southern Hemisphere. That\u2019s because ozone is also a powerful greenhouse gas, and destroying it has made the stratosphere (the second layer of the atmosphere going upwards) over the Southern Hemisphere colder. The colder stratosphere has resulted in faster winds near the pole, which somewhat surprisingly can have impacts all the way to the equator, affecting tropical circulation and rainfall at lower latitudes. The ozone hole is not causing global warming, but it is affecting atmospheric circulation.", 
  "OYPDIRQIWOBGHMJQC": "Since every wiggle is not necessarily significant, modellers need to assess how robust particular model results are. They do this by seeing whether the same result is seen in other simulations, with other models, whether it makes physical sense and whether there is some evidence of similar things in the observational or paleo record. If that result is seen in multiple models and multiple simulations, it is likely to be a robust consequence of the underlying assumptions, or in other words, it probably isn\u2019t due to any of the relatively arbitrary choices that mark the differences between different models. If the magnitude of the effect makes theoretical sense independent of these kinds of model, then that adds to it\u2019s credibility, and if in fact this effect matches what is seen in observations, then that adds more. Robust results are therefore those that quantitatively match in all three domains. Examples are the warming of planet as a function of increasing greenhouse gases, or the change in water vapour with temperature. All models show basically the same behaviour that is in line with basic theory and observations. Examples of non-robust results are the changes in El Ni\u00f1o as a result of climate forcings, or the impact on hurricanes. In both of these cases, models produce very disparate results, the theory is not yet fully developed and observations are ambiguous.",

Differences in exposure to sunlight, cloud cover, atmospheric circulation patterns, aerosol concentrations, atmospheric humidity, land surface cover, etc., vary from place to place. These differences influence whether and how much a location is warming or cooling.", 
  "PBDBYDGOYBWTQUYLMQL": "The best climate models encapsulate the current understanding of the physical processes involved in the climate system, the interactions, and the performance of the system as a whole. They have been extensively tested and evaluated using observations. They are exceedingly useful tools for carrying out numerical climate experiments, but they are not perfect, and some models are better than others. Uncertainties arise from shortcomings in our understanding of climate processes operating in the atmosphere, ocean, land and cryosphere, and how to best represent those processes in models. Yet, in spite of these uncertainties, today's best climate models are now able to reproduce the climate of the past century, and simulations of the evolution of global surface temperature over the past millennium are consistent with paleoclimate reconstructions. This gives increased confidence in future projections. The shortcomings in our understanding of the processes involved in climate and how they are depicted in models arise from inadequate observations and theoretical underpinnings associated with the incredible complexity of dealing with scales from molecules and cloud droplets to the planetary-scale atmospheric circulation. These issues are addressed in several steps:  Individual climate processes are dealt with as best as is possible given the understanding and computational limitations. The processes are assembled in models and then the model components are tested with strong constraints. The components include modules of the atmosphere, the oceans, the land and sea ice, and the land surface. These modules are coupled together to mimic the real world. The climate system model as a whole is then integrated in an unconstrained mode and thoroughly tested against observations. One strong test is to simulate the annual cycle of seasonal variations (the changes in climate from winter to summer). Another is to simulate observed variability from one year to the next. Yet another is to simulate past climate, even going back in time thousands or millions of years tested against records from ice cores, tree rings, and other \"proxy\" data.  As our knowledge of the different components of the climate system and their interactions increases, so does the complexity of today's climate models. Also, many of the most pressing scientific questions regarding the climate system and its response to natural and anthropogenic forcings cannot be readily addressed with traditional models of the physical climate. One of the open issues for near-term climate change, for example, is the response of terrestrial ecosystems to increased concentrations of carbon dioxide. Will plants begin releasing carbon dioxide to the atmosphere in a warmer climate, thereby acting as a positive feedback, or will vegetation absorb more carbon dioxide and hence decelerate global warming? Related issues include the interactions among land use change, deforestation by biomass burning, emission of greenhouse gases and aerosols, weathering of rocks, carbon in soils, and marine biogeochemistry.  Exploration of these questions requires a comprehensive treatment of the integrative Earth system. In order to address these emerging issues, physical models are being extended to include the interactions of climate with biogeochemistry, atmospheric chemistry, ecosystems, glaciers and ice sheets, and anthropogenic environmental change. These new \"Earth System Models\", however, will require large investments in computing infrastructure before they can be fully utilized.", 
  "PGSNRGZBLBAYFQI": "Global average surface temperatures have increased by about 0.74\u00b0C (1.33\u00b0F) between 1906 and 2005 (IPCC 2007), although the rate and magnitude of change differs with location and the period examined. While 0.74\u00b0C may not seem like a large temperature change, on a global scale this has huge implications for many of the earth's processes that effect ecosystems and humans. Even with this relatively modest temperature change, clear effects have been observed.  For example, in concurrence with observed temperature changes, in the 20th century there has been a nearly worldwide reduction in glacial mass and extent, a decrease in snow cover in many Northern Hemisphere regions, a decrease in Arctic sea ice thickness and extent, a decrease in the length of river and lake ice seasons, warmer ocean temperatures, and rising sea levels (IPCC 2007).  From 1900 to 2005, long-term changes in precipitation trends have also been observed, leading to wetter conditions in some areas (eastern North and South America, northern Europe, northern and central Asia) and drier in others (the Sahel, southern Africa, the Mediterranean, southern Asia). Widespread increases in heavy precipitation events have been observed, even in places where total precipitation amounts have decreased (IPCC 2007).

  "PVALJUQUGHLJMNHM": "The Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states: it is a greater than a 90 percent certainty that emissions of heat-trapping gases from human activities have caused \u201cmost of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century.\u201d We all know that warming\u2014and cooling\u2014has happened in the past, and long before humans were around. Many factors (called \u201cclimate drivers\u201d) can influence Earth\u2019s climate\u2014such as changes in the sun\u2019s intensity and volcanic eruptions, as well as heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere.  So how do scientists know that today\u2019s warming is primarily caused by humans putting too much carbon in the atmosphere when we burn coal, oil, and gas or cut down forests?  There are human fingerprints on carbon overload. When humans burn coal, oil and gas (fossil fuels) to generate electricity or drive our cars, carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, where it traps heat. A carbon molecule that comes from fossil fuels and deforestation is \u201clighter\u201d than the combined signal of those from other sources.  As scientists measure the \u201cweight\u201d of carbon in the atmosphere over time they see a clear increase in the lighter molecules from fossil fuel and deforestation sources that correspond closely to the known trend in emissions.  Natural changes alone can\u2019t explain the temperature changes we\u2019ve seen. For a computer model to accurately project the future climate, scientists must first ensure that it accurately reproduces observed temperature changes.  When the models include only recorded natural climate drivers\u2014such as the sun\u2019s intensity\u2014the models cannot accurately reproduce the observed warming of the past half century. When human-induced climate drivers are also included in the models, then they accurately capture recent temperature increases in the atmosphere and in the oceans. [4][5][6] When all the natural and human-induced climate drivers are compared to one another, the dramatic accumulation of carbon from human sources is by far the largest climate change driver over the past half century. Lower-level atmosphere\u2014which contains the carbon load\u2014is expanding. The boundary between the lower atmosphere (troposphere) and the higher atmosphere (stratosphere) has shifted upward in recent decades. See the ozone FAQ for a figure illustrating the layers of the atmosphere. [6][7][8]This boundary has likely changed because heat-trapping gases accumulate in the lower atmosphere and that atmospheric layer expands as it heats up (much like warming the air in a balloon). And because less heat is escaping into the higher atmosphere, it is likely cooling. This differential would not occur if the sun was the sole climate driver, as solar changes would warm both atmospheric layers, and certainly would not have warmed one while cooling the other.",

Carbon dioxide is of greatest concern because its rate of increase is exerting a larger overall warming influence than all of those other gases combined, and because carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere will remain elevated for centuries unless we implement a way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere effectively and economically. Most carbon dioxide from human activities is released from burning coal and other fossil fuels.

  "QEMYFMPNYLZFYREBPMN": "Yes, Earth has warmed and cooled naturally throughout its history. For example, increases or decreases in the Sun's brightness would have caused short-term warming and cooling. Also, major volcanic eruptions can cause short-term cooling. For example, in 1991, Mt. Pinatubo erupted with such force it injected sulfate gases and particles into the stratosphere, above where rain clouds form. There, these reflective aerosol particles lingered for almost a year and spread around the globe. Pinatubo's volcanic particle plume scattered and reflected so much sunlight back to space that it actually caused Earth to cool by about 0.9\u00b0F (0.5\u00b0C) that year.  Additionally, Earth has experienced longer term cold periods (\"ice ages\") and warm periods (\"interglacials\") on 100,000-year cycles for at least the last million years. Going from an ice age to an interglacial and back again, Earth's average temperature changed anywhere from 7\u00b0F to 12.5\u00b0F (4-7\u00b0C). These fluctuations in global average temperature happened because gradual, ongoing changes in Earth's orbital mechanics changed our planet's tilt relative to the sun. The gradual shift in Earth's tilt changed where and how much sunlight fell on the Northern Hemisphere. Thus, there was a slight increase in the amount of sunlight shining where most of our planet's landmass is located, which was just enough to nudge our world in a warming direction. As Earth began to transition from an ice age to an interglacial, other factors (known as \"climate feedbacks\") in the climate system came into play and added to the warming.[20] For example:  the large ice sheets on North America, Europe, and Asia shrank, which changed the land cover from a mostly bright white reflector to a dark green or brown absorber of solar energy and added to the warming[20]; global cloudiness may have declined, which would have allowed more sunlight to reach the surface and add to the warming[20]; as the land and oceans warmed, they released more carbon dioxide and methane (heat-trapping gases) which added to the warming[20]; and lightning-triggered wildfires probably grew more frequent, and burned over larger areas, thereby accelerating the conversion of forest biomass into carbon dioxide and methane gas, which added to the warming.[20] As Earth's orbital mechanics tilted the Northern Hemisphere away from the sun, these processes slowed or reversed, leading to ice ages. These processes explain why Earth has warmed and cooled on roughly 100,000-year cycles for at least the last 1 million years.", 
  "QIAPKYOBBIURXUDF": "Clouds and precipitation (rain or snow, depending on where you are) form mainly when warm, humid air is forced to rise. As it rises, it expands and cools and the amount of water vapour that can be held is reduced. Any surplus water vapour condenses and forms droplets, which we see as clouds, and may become large enough to fall to the Earth\u2019s surface as rain or snow.  In the tropics, the ascent is vigorous and huge cumulonimbus clouds (thunder clouds) form, reaching over 10km high and frequently grouping into clusters. They form preferentially over the oceans, where there is a large source of warm water to evaporate. However, in the mid-latitudes, ascent is more localised and less deep, resulting in more shallow, individual cumulus.", 
  "QIBIQPGPCJKKNFIQ": "Part of our post dataset production quality assurance is to test the data to see if we can identify any biases in them. Alleged biases have been investigated as follows:  We identified which GHCN stations were rural and which were urban. Then we created global temperature time series from the rural only stations and compared that to our full dataset. The result was that the two showed almost identical time series (actually the rural showed a little bit more warming) so there apparently was no lingering urban heat island bias in the adjusted GHCN dataset. The USHCN 'time of observations' adjustment was reevaluated using data that did not contribute to the original calculation of the adjustment. The results indicated that on a national average the adjustment was very accurate. Stations in eastern Colorado had poor siting and it was postulated that their data records were biased due to that siting. Evaluation of data from those stations showed that the temperature from the three stations with poor siting matched the temperature at the two stations with good siting. The stations with good siting needed almost no adjustments to account for changes in, for example, their time of observation or type of thermometer. So this analysis also provided evidence that the adjustments were effective in bringing station with many problems in their raw data into accord with nearby stations that didn't need adjustments. A forthcoming journal article by Menne, Williams and Palecki, confirms that there is a small cold bias in the U.S. temperature record associated with poor station siting: the temperature has actually warmed a bit more than the data indicate and we haven't yet developed an approach to account for this bias. In ocean data, over the last decade an international effort, led by NOAA, has dramatically increased the number of drifting buoys providing sea surface temperature data. Preliminary analysis of co-located ship and buoy data indicates that recent ship data are warmer than buoy observations. The increase in buoy observations and decrease in ship observations may require a different bias adjustment. Further study is needed to completely remove this effect from the data. The two plots below are of global temperature time series, the top one uses the adjusted version of GHCN and the bottom one uses the raw GHCN data. Both time series reveal that the earth is warming. This indicates that the observed warming cannot be an artifact of the adjustment process as the unadjusted GHCN version shows similar amounts of warming and the adjustments applied to raw ocean data decrease the amount of indicated warming.", 
  "QIDOIBXHQLDYMXXVA": "The amount of data that is available for model evaluation is vast, but falls into a few clear categories. First, there is the climatological average (maybe for each month or season) of key observed fields like temperature, rainfall, winds and clouds. This is the zeroth order comparison to see whether the model is getting the basics reasonably correct. Next comes the variability in these basic fields \u2013 does the model have a realistic North Atlantic Oscillation, or ENSO, or MJO. These are harder to match (and indeed many models do not yet have realistic El Ni\u00f1os). More subtle are comparisons of relationships in the model and in the real world. This is useful for short data records (such as those retrieves by satellite) where there is a lot of weather noise one wouldn\u2019t expect the model to capture. In those cases, looking at the relationship between temperatures and humidity, or cloudiness and aerosols can give insight into whether the model processes are realistic or not.  Then there are the tests of climate changes themselves: how does a model respond to the addition of aerosols in the stratosphere such as was seen in the Mt Pinatubo \u2018natural experiment\u2019? How does it respond over the whole of the 20th Century, or at the Maunder Minimum, or the mid-Holocene or the Last Glacial Maximum? In each case, there is usually sufficient data available to evaluate how well the model is doing.", 
  "QJHLQIDVGVZTBWC": "Air pollution occurs when the air contains gases, dust, fumes or odor in harmful amounts\u2014aerosols are a subset of air pollution that refers to the tiny particles suspended everywhere in our atmosphere. These particles can be both solid and liquid and are collectively referred to as \u2018atmospheric aerosol particles\u2019 [1]. Most are produced by natural processes such as erupting volcanoes, and some are from human industrial and agricultural activities (see Figure 1). Those particles in the lowest layer of the atmosphere, where our weather occurs, usually stay relatively close to the source of emissions and remain in the atmosphere only a few days to a week before they fall to the ground or are rained out; those higher up in the atmosphere travel farther and may linger in the atmosphere for a few years.   Light-colored aerosol particles can reflect incoming energy from the sun (heat) in cloud-free air and dark particles can absorb it.  Aerosols can modify how much energy clouds reflect and they can change atmospheric circulation patterns\u2014in short, aerosols can modify our climate [2].  Several climate engineering (so-called \u2018geoengineering\u2019) strategies for reducing global warming propose using atmospheric aerosol particles to reflect the sun\u2019s energy away from Earth. Because aerosol particles do not stay in the atmosphere for very long\u2014and global warming gases stay in the atmosphere for decades to centuries\u2014accumulated heat-trapping gases will overpower any temporary cooling due to short-lived aerosol particles.", 
  "QTRUKEBYRNHTUCVCTT": "Yes, global warming is impacting species and habitats across America and around the world. According to the U.S.'s National Fish, Wildlife, and Plants Climate Adaptation Strategy, warmer temperatures, rising sea levels, and other climate-related changes are stressing countless species of plants, animals, and fish.[10] Adaptable species with wide geographic ranges\u2014such as white-tailed deer and feral hogs\u2014are likely to continue to thrive. But those species that depend on particular habitats\u2014such as the southwestern willow flycatcher (bird) and coldwater fishes\u2014are vulnerable.[10]  Here are some specific examples (selected from among many that are available)[10]:  Warmer temperatures and droughts are expected to put some of the 750 million acres of forests in the United States under greater stress, cause decreased productivity, and increase risk of fire. Millions of acres of lodgepole pine and other conifer trees across the West have been killed by an epidemic outbreak of mountain pine beetles. Warmer temperatures have enabled more beetles to survive the winter and earlier arrivals of spring have allowed the insect to reproduce more generations per year while expanding their range. Roughly 285 million acres of grasslands in the U.S. stretch from Canada to the Gulf Coast, and include tallgrass prairie, cattle pastures, and prairie pothole wetlands that serve as breeding grounds for ducks. Warmer, drier conditions expected from climate change will likely dry up wetlands, speed the invasion of non-native grasses and pests, contribute to more fires, and reduce the quality of forage for livestock and wildlife. Many of the nation's lakes, rivers, and streams are expected to warm. Coldwater fish like trout and salmon will be adversely affected, while warmer water species like bass will expand their range. Falling water levels, especially in the Great Lakes, will lead to shoreline habitat loss, affecting nursery grounds and nesting areas. Many commercial and recreational fish stocks along the East Coast have shifted their distributions northward from 25 to 200 miles over the past 40 years as ocean temperatures have increased. As the ocean absorbs much of the additional carbon dioxide humans put into the atmosphere, its waters grow more acidic. In 2007-08, two major West Coast oyster hatcheries found that their oyster larvae were dying due to the higher acidity of the seawater being pumped into their facilities. Small increases in ocean temperature severely stress corals and cause them to expel the symbiotic algae that nourish them and give them their vibrant colors. This process, known as \"coral bleaching,\" changes their color to a dull white and leaves this vibrant ecosystem dead or dying.",

  "QVBXHAOYSHUZPRPTNC": "No. By a large majority, climate scientists agree that average global temperature today is warmer than in pre-industrial times, and that human activity is a significant contributing factor.[23,24,25]  The United States' foremost scientific agencies and organizations have recognized global warming as a human-caused problem that should be addressed. The U.S. Global Change Research Program has published a series of scientific reports documenting the causes and impacts of global climate change. NOAA, NASA, the National Science Foundation, the National Research Council, and the Environmental Protection Agency have all published reports and fact sheets stating that Earth is warming mainly due to the increase in human-produced heat-trapping gases.  The American Meteorological Society (AMS) issued this position statement: \"Warming of the climate system now is unequivocal, according to many different kinds of evidence. ... many of the observed changes noted above are beyond what can be explained by the natural variability of the climate. It is clear from extensive scientific evidence that the dominant cause of the rapid change in climate of the past half century is human-induced increases in the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases,...\" (Adopted Aug. 20, 2012)  The American Geophysical Union (AGU) issued this position statement: \"Human-induced climate change requires urgent action. Humanity is the major influence on the global climate observed over the last 50 years. Rapid societal responses can significantly lessen negative outcomes.\" (Published Aug. 2013)  In 2009, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) reaffirmed the position of its Board of Directors and the leaders of 18 respected organizations, who concluded based on multiple lines of scientific evidence that global climate change caused by human activities is now underway, and it is a growing threat to society.",

  "RIKXAGBDMEAHSEV": "The greenhouse gases being released by human activity are often called \u201ccarbon emissions,\u201d just for shorthand. That is because the two most important of the gases, carbon dioxide and methane, contain carbon. Many other gases also trap heat near the Earth\u2019s surface, and many human activities cause the release of such gases to the atmosphere. Not all of these actually contain carbon, but they have all come to be referred to by the same shorthand.  By far the biggest factor causing global warming is the burning of fossil fuels for electricity and transportation. That process takes carbon that has been underground for millions of years and moves it into the atmosphere, as carbon dioxide, where it will influence the climate for many centuries into the future. Methane is even more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide, but it breaks down more quickly in the air. Methane comes from swamps, from the decay of food in landfills, from cattle and dairy farming, and from leaks in natural gas wells and pipelines.  While fossil-fuel emissions are the major issue, another major creator of emissions is the destruction of forests, particularly in the tropics. Billions of tons of carbon are stored in trees, and when forests are cleared, much of the vegetation is burned, sending that carbon into the air as carbon dioxide.  When you hear about carbon taxes, carbon trading and so on, these are just shorthand descriptions of methods designed to limit greenhouse emissions or to make them more expensive so that people will be encouraged to conserve fuel.", 
  "RIVGSJWZMAONVCGW": "In principle, we can slow the rate of global warming by slowing the emission rates of heat-trapping gases\u2014mainly carbon dioxide\u2014and black carbon aerosol to the atmosphere. Some continued warming is inevitable. Stabilizing global temperature at its current level would be very difficult because it would require cutting the emission of heat-trapping gases all the way to zero. If and when zero emissions becomes possible, temperatures won't start to recover until heat-trapping gases are actually removed from the atmosphere. Such removal happens naturally on time scales ranging from less than a year (e.g., black carbon aerosol) to centuries (e.g., carbon dioxide). Additionally, technical means exist to remove some heat-trapping gases (including carbon dioxide) from the atmosphere.  Ultimately, global warming could be reversed by returning the abundance of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere to pre-industrial levels (circa 1750). The challenge in slowing or reducing global warming is finding a way to make these changes on a global scale that is technically, economically, socially, and politically viable. Reducing our emission of carbon dioxide has the added benefit of slowing the rate at which humans are making the ocean's water more acidic, which is a threat to shell-forming organisms and the marine food chain.  In response to a request from the U.S. Congress, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences published a series of peer-reviewed reports, titled America's Climate Choices, to provide authoritative analyses to inform and guide responses to climate change across the nation. Relevant to this question, the NAS report titled Limiting the Magnitude of Future Climate Change explains policies that could be adopted to slow or even reverse global warming. The report says, \"Meeting internationally discussed targets for limiting atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and associated increases in global average temperatures will require a major departure from business as usual in how the world uses and produces energy.\"  Alternative methods to slow or reduce global warming have been proposed that are, collectively, known as \"climate engineering\" or \"geo-engineering.\" Some geo-engineering proposals involve cooling Earth's surface by injecting reflective particles into the upper atmosphere to scatter and reflect sunlight back to space. Other proposals involve seeding the oceans with iron to stimulate large-scale phytoplankton blooms, thereby drawing down carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Such methods could work, in principle, but many climate scientists oppose undertaking geo-engineering until we have a much better understanding of the possible side effects. Additionally, there are unresolved legal and ethical issues surrounding geo-engineering.  Given these concerns, the American Meteorological Society published a position paper (readopted in January 2013) in which it said: \"...research to date has not determined whether there are large-scale geo-engineering approaches that would produce significant benefits, or whether those benefits would substantially outweigh the detriments. Indeed, geo-engineering must be viewed with caution because manipulating the Earth system has considerable potential to trigger adverse and unpredictable consequences.\"", 
  "RKSIJYFIGYRSGKYUEK": "Climate is generally defined as average weather, and as such, climate change and weather are intertwined. Observations can show that there have been changes in weather, and it is the statistics of changes in weather over time that identify climate change. While weather and climate are closely related, there are important differences. A common confusion between weather and climate arises when scientists are asked how they can predict climate 50 years from now when they cannot predict the weather a few weeks from now. The chaotic nature of weather makes it unpredictable beyond a few days. Projecting changes in climate (i.e., long-term average weather) due to changes in atmospheric composition or other factors is a very different and much more manageable issue. As an analogy, while it is impossible to predict the age at which any particular man will die, we can say with high confidence that the average age of death for men in industrialised countries is about 75. Another common confusion of these issues is thinking that a cold winter or a cooling spot on the globe is evidence against global warming. There are always extremes of hot and cold, although their frequency and intensity change as climate changes. But when weather is averaged over space and time, the fact that the globe is warming emerges clearly from the data.",

These scientists reviewed all the published and peer-reviewed scientific information produced during the previous few years to assess what is known about the global climate, why and how it changes, what it will mean for people and the environment, and what can be done about it.  The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report is the most comprehensive evaluation of global warming that serves as the basis for international climate negotiations.

  "SCRTTIOTIDLRDACLO": "Models in statistics or in many colloquial uses of the term often imply a simple relationship that is fitted to some observations. A linear regression line through a change of temperature with time, or a sinusoidal fit to the seasonal cycle for instance. More complicated fits are also possible (neural nets for instance). These statistical models are very efficient at encapsulating existing information concisely and as long as things don\u2019t change much, they can provide reasonable predictions of future behaviour. However, they aren\u2019t much good for predictions if you know the underlying system is changing in ways that might possibly affect how your original variables will interact.  Physics-based models on the other hand, try to capture the real physical cause of any relationship, which hopefully are understood at a deeper level. Since those fundamentals are not likely to change in the future, the anticipation of a successful prediction is higher. A classic example is Newton\u2019s Law of motion, F=ma, which can be used in multiple contexts to give highly accurate results completely independently of the data Newton himself had on hand.  Climate models are fundamentally physics-based, but some of the small scale physics is only known empirically (for instance, the increase of evaporation as the wind increases). Thus statistical fits to the observed data are included in the climate model formulation, but these are only used for process-level parameterisations, not for trends in time.",

Some scientists think that sample return is the only way to get a definitive result, although it might require several attempts to get the right samples and it is very expensive (about $10 billion for Mars). And even positive results might still be controversial. In-situ analysis is a less expensive approach, but still on the order of $1 billion to $2 billion per mission, and results would likely be controversial.  Maybe we\u2019ll get lucky and find credible evidence in a Martian meteorite, but then the possibility of terrestrial contamination is very difficult to rule out. It was previously announced that signs of life were found in a Martian meteorite, but the strong consensus of the scientific community is now against this conclusion.  Icy moons in the outer solar system, such as Saturn\u2019s Enceladus, could harbor life, but we know much less about these worlds than about Mars and need more basic robotic exploration. The outer solar system is even more expensive to explore than is Mars.  The good news is that efforts to find life result in new knowledge about the physical and chemical processes and geologic history of these interesting worlds. For example, the Viking Orbiters (which carried the Mars landers to search for life in the 1970s) revolutionized our understanding of Mars\u2019 global geology, soil and atmosphere.

The atmospheric component of the climate system most obviously characterises climate; climate is often defined as \u2018average weather\u2019. Climate is usually described in terms of the mean and variability of temperature, precipitation and wind over a period of time, ranging from months to millions of years (the classical period is 30 years). The climate system evolves in time under the influence of its own internal dynamics and due to changes in external factors that affect climate (called \u2018forcings\u2019). External forcings include natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions and solar variations, as well as human-induced changes in atmospheric composition. Solar radiation powers the climate system. There are three fundamental ways to change the radiation balance of the Earth: 1) by changing the incoming solar radiation (e.g., by changes in Earth\u2019s orbit or in the Sun itself); 2) by changing the fraction of solar radiation that is reflected (called \u2018albedo\u2019; e.g., by changes in cloud cover, atmospheric particles or vegetation); and 3) by altering the longwave radiation from Earth back towards space (e.g., by changing greenhouse gas concentrations). Climate, in turn, responds directly to such changes, as well as indirectly, through a variety of feedback mechanisms.", 
  "SZWQIUFLVEEFNUP": "A rise in global temperatures increases the severity and likelihood of storms, floods, wildfires, droughts and heat waves. In a warmer climate, the atmosphere can collect, retain and drop more water, making wet areas wetter and dry areas drier. Increased precipitation can help support agriculture, but more frequent and intense storms damage property, infrastructure, and lead to loss of life in vulnerable areas. Over the past few decades, the United States has experienced more heat waves and fewer cold waves.  Global warming also results in warmer oceans, making it easier for hurricanes to form; over the past 20 years, tropical storm activity in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico has increased in intensity, frequency, and duration.  It is very difficult for researchers to attribute a specific weather event to global warming. Nevertheless, climate scientists are confident that the higher temperatures we are experiencing are making extreme weather more likely, with all the costs that entails.

This ideological position has been propped up by money from fossil-fuel interests, which have paid to create organizations, fund conferences and the like. The scientific arguments made by these groups usually involve cherry-picking data, such as focusing on short-term blips in the temperature record or in sea ice, while ignoring the long-term trends.  The most extreme version of climate denialism is to claim that scientists are engaged in a worldwide hoax to fool the public so that the government can gain greater control over people\u2019s lives.

  "TIWZIULGZNQJRODGC": "The ocean helps to reduce both the causes and effects of global warming. The ocean absorbs about 30% of all human-produced carbon dioxide, thereby keeping large amounts of this heat-trapping gas out of the atmosphere.[14] The ocean also absorbs more than 80% of all excess heat in the Earth's system, where excess heat is the difference between the sun's total incoming energy and the total energy leaving Earth's system.[17,18] Ocean absorption of excess heat is currently helping to slow the rate of global warming.  Carbon dioxide is absorbed in the ocean at a rate that depends on temperature. Under natural conditions the ocean serves as a carbon dioxide source during warming periods and a carbon dioxide sink during cooling periods. The warmer the ocean grows, the more it will become a source of carbon dioxide, thereby contributing to global warming.  Also, the ocean serves as a massive source of water vapor. As Earth's temperature rises, the rate of evaporation increases too. Since water vapor is also a heat-trapping gas, changes in the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere serve to amplify temperature changes caused by other factors such as carbon dioxide.",

People, plants, and animals living under the ozone hole are harmed by the solar radiation now reaching the Earth's surface\u2014where it causes health problems from eye damage to skin cancer.  The ozone hole, however, is not the mechanism of global warming. Ultraviolet radiation represents less than one percent of the energy from the sun\u2014not enough to be the cause of the excess heat from human activities. Global warming is caused primarily from putting too much carbon into the atmosphere when coal, gas, and oil are burned to generate electricity or to run our cars. These gases spread around the planet like a blanket, capturing the solar heat that would otherwise be radiated out into space. (For more detail on the basic mechanism of global warming, see carbon dioxide FAQ.)  Both of these environmental problems do, however, have a common cause\u2014human activities that release gases into and alter the atmosphere. Ozone depletion occurs when chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)\u2014formerly found in aerosol spray cans and refrigerants\u2014are released into the atmosphere. These gases, through several chemical reactions, cause the ozone molecules to break down, reducing ozone's ultraviolet (UV) radiation-absorbing capacity.

  "UPRPESVTZWERBYUTJGX": "The greenhouse effect is the process by which certain gases in the atmosphere absorb and re-emit energy that would otherwise be lost into space (IPCC 2007, Chapter 1).  The Earth's transparent atmosphere lets sunlight through to warm the ground and the oceans (more when it is clear, less when it is cloudy). The Earth's warmed surface releases some of that heat in the form of infrared radiation, a form of light, but invisible to human eyes. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere like carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and water vapor, absorb this infrared radiation and keep it from passing out into space. This energy is then reradiated in all directions, and the energy that is directed back toward the Earth's surface warms the planet.  The greenhouse effect is necessary for human survival, since without it the Earth's average temperature would be about 0 C (Swanston et al. 2011). However current concentrations of greenhouse gases are higher now than they have been for the past 800,000 years encompassing the history of human development, and are enhancing the greenhouse effect.  The 'greenhouse effect' gets its name from the fact that a fairly similar process takes place in a greenhouse. The glass panes on a greenhouse let incoming sunlight pass through them, but intercept some of the infrared light on its way back out, warming the interior (Climate Central 2009).", 
  "UWOYWFJWTJASTBA": "The effects of current emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases on climate can take decades to fully manifest themselves. The resulting change in climate and the impacts of those changes can then persist for a long time. The longer these changes in climate continue, the greater the resulting impacts. It will become increasingly costly to adapt, and some systems will not be able to adapt if the change is too much or too fast. Thus it is not surprising that recent reports from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, including America\u2019s Climate Choices and America\u2019s Energy Future, have concluded that the environmental, economic, and humanitarian risks posed by climate change indicate a pressing need for substantial action to limit the magnitude of climate change and to prepare to adapt to its impacts. They also concluded that substantial reductions of heat-trapping gas emissions should be among the nation\u2019s highest priorities.", 
  "UYGUOTRLGFDVRQAYXX": "Yes, the vast majority of actively publishing climate scientists \u2013 97 percent \u2013 agree that humans are causing global warming and climate change. Most of the leading science organizations around the world have issued public statements expressing this, including international and U.S. science academies, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and a whole host of reputable scientific bodies around the world). The number of peer-reviewed scientific papers that reject the consensus on human-caused global warming is a vanishingly small proportion of the published research. The small amount of dissent tends to come from a few vocal scientists who are not experts in the climate field or do not understand the scientific basis of long-term climate processes.", 
  "UZFLECNIQMUGCPPJB": "Scientists who study the climate are still arguing about how fast the earth is warming and how much it will warm, but they do agree that the earth is warming and that it will keep warming if we don\u2019t do anything about it.  ", 
  "UZGTGBNQRMJCUXU": "The terms climate change and global warming are often used interchangeably, but climate change refers to both the rise in global temperatures because of human activities and the many impacts this rise has on the planet\u2014such as more intense and frequent droughts and storms, melting glaciers and ice sheets, rising sea levels, warming seas (which can cause coral reef bleaching and disrupt the marine food chain), and ocean acidification (see question 7). Climate change can also refer to natural fluctuations in the Earth\u2019s average temperature between cold periods (ice ages) and warm periods.  The climate change we are currently experiencing is almost certainly manmade in origin (see question 2). Scientists have concluded that, over the last 50 years, the Earth\u2019s surface should have been cooling slightly based on natural factors, like solar intensity and volcano activity; instead, the increased burning of fossil fuels has led to global warming\u2014and at a significantly faster rate than at any time over the last 800,000 years.  People around the world are already feeling the impact of climate change on the environment. A hotter atmosphere means extreme weather is more likely and potentially more devastating: droughts, flooding, and more severe storms have all become more common. Changing weather patterns can ruin crops and cause serious water shortages. Rising sea levels are threatening low-lying islands and coastal cities. Tropical and insect-borne diseases are spreading as their hosts colonize new habitats that were previously too cold for them to survive.  Climate change represents a significant threat to the health and well-being of human societies, especially in vulnerable areas of the developing world where people are ill-equipped to deal with the side effects of a warmer climate.", 
  "VBMGRJMUHKKKRPCWK": "Because most human-produced heat-trapping gases come from burning fossil fuels, there is great potential for the collective actions of many individuals worldwide to reduce global warming by making changes in their daily and annual activities that produce heat-trapping gases and aerosols. Specifically, people can consider making the following choices in their personal lives:  reduce household energy use through use of energy efficient appliances and heating and air conditioning systems; increase investments in renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power systems; avoid unnecessary household energy use through lighting and temperature control options as well as the use of power strips with switches enabling people to turn off always-on \"vampire\" appliances (i.e., computers and cable TV boxes); and limit travel distances in conventional automobiles and aircraft while choosing energy-efficient mass transportation options, such as trains and buses, where possible. Making the best choices to reduce emissions requires accurate and quantitative information about how our different lifestyles cause emissions. Examples of direct emissions are energy use in households, automobiles, and air travel. Indirect emissions result from production and distribution of goods used in household and businesses. More guidance on courses of action can be found in the National Academy of Sciences' 2010 report, titled Informing an Effective Response to Climate Change.  As addressed in previous questions, stabilizing global temperature at its current level requires eliminating all emissions of heat-trapping gases or, equivalently, achieving a carbon-neutral society in which people remove as much carbon from the atmosphere as they emit. Achieving this goal will require substantial societal changes in energy technologies and infrastructure that go far beyond the collective actions of individuals and households to reduce emissions", 
  "VBSQIHCOPQAWQDFV": "Agriculture of all types produces greenhouse gases that warm the planet, but meat production is especially harmful \u2014 and beef is the most environmentally damaging form of meat. Some methods of cattle production demand a lot of land, contributing to destruction of forests; the trees are typically burned, releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Other methods require huge amounts of water and fertilizer to grow food for the cows.  The cows themselves produce emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that causes short-term warming. Meat consumption is rising worldwide as the population grows, and as economic development makes people richer and better able to afford meat.  This trend is worrisome. Studies have found that if the whole world were to start eating beef at the rate Americans eat it, produced by the methods typically used in the United States, that alone might erase any chance of staying below an internationally agreed-upon limit on global warming. Pork production creates somewhat lower emissions than beef production, and chicken lower still. So reducing your meat consumption, or switching from beef and pork to chicken in your diet, are moves in the right direction. Of course, as with any kind of behavioral change meant to benefit the climate, this will only make a difference if lots of other people do it, too, reducing the overall demand for meat products.", 
  "VBWLNPCCNKLLPLKP": "Multiple analyses of the peer-reviewed science literature have repeatedly shown that more than 97% of scientists in this field agree that the world is unequivocally warming and that human activity is the primary cause of the warming experienced over the past 50 years. Spirited debates on some details of climate science continue, but these fundamental conclusions are not in dispute.", 
  "VIHUGAGPVOHWADQZGMO": "The idea that Earth is sensitive to greenhouse gases is confirmed by many lines of scientific evidence. For instance, the basic physics suggesting that an increase of carbon dioxide traps more heat was discovered in the 19th century, and has been verified in thousands of laboratory experiments.  Climate science does contain uncertainties, of course. The biggest is the degree to which global warming sets off feedback loops, such as a melting of sea ice that will darken the surface and cause more heat to be absorbed, melting more ice, and so forth. It is not clear exactly how much the feedbacks will intensify the warming; some of them could even partly offset it. This uncertainty means that computer forecasts can give only a range of future climate possibilities, not absolute predictions.  But even if those computer forecasts did not exist, a huge amount of evidence suggests that scientists have the basic story right. The most important evidence comes from the study of past climate conditions, a field known as paleoclimate research. The amount of carbon dioxide in the air has fluctuated naturally in the past, and every time it rises, the Earth warms up, ice melts and the ocean rises. A hundred miles inland from today\u2019s East Coast of the United States, seashells can be dug from ancient beaches that are three million years old, a blink of an eye in geologic time.  These past conditions are not a perfect guide to the future, because humans are pumping carbon dioxide into the air far faster than nature has ever done. But they show it would be foolish to assume that modern society is somehow immune to large-scale, threatening changes. ", 
  "VKGSMNITPIPLQWAA": "There is overwhelming scientific evidence that Earth is warming and a preponderance of scientific evidence that human activities are the main cause. Thousands of weather stations worldwide\u2014over land and ocean\u2014have been recording daily high and low temperatures for many decades and, in some locations, for more than a century. When different scientific and technical teams in different U.S. agencies (e.g., NOAA and NASA) and in other countries (e.g., the U.K.'s Hadley Centre) average these data together, essentially the same results are found: Earth's average surface temperature has risen by about 1.5\u00b0F (0.85\u00b0C) since 1880.[15]  The primary cause is that, over the last 200 years, human activities have added about 500 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, increasing the abundance of this heat-trapping gas by about 40 percent. Today, humans add about 70 million metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere every day. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased from about 278 parts per million (ppm) in 1800 to about 398 ppm today.[19] Today's carbon dioxide levels are unusually high; much higher than at any other time in the last 800,000 years. The warming influence of heat-trapping gases was recognized in the mid-1800s", 
  "VLCNXPVVWVVVAWW": "Tipping points are thresholds beyond which there will be large, rapid and possibly irreversible changes in the climate system. The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are one example \u2013 beyond a certain level, warming will cause large and irreversible loss of ice, and sea level rise of many metres over the ensuing centuries. Thresholds also exist for ecosystems, such as the Great Barrier Reef, and the services they provide, including food production and water supply.  We need to know what these thresholds are, the consequences of crossing them, and how much and how fast we will have to reduce emissions in order to avoid this.", 
  "VNPOUAIIJKGKIZXG": "\"Global warming\" refers to an increase in Earth's annually averaged air temperature near the surface. Thermometer readings are collected from many thousands of weather stations around the world\u2014over land and ocean\u2014and then used to produce a global average temperature for each year. The resulting series of annual averages of global temperature from 1880 to 2012 show that Earth has warmed by 1.5\u00b0F (0.85\u00b0C).[1] Most of that warming has occurred since 1976.  \"Climate change\" is a broadly inclusive term that refers to a long-term (decades to centuries) change in any of a number of environmental conditions for a given place and time\u2014such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, cloudiness, wind and air circulation patterns, etc. These oscillations and other similar phenomena can influence weather and climate patterns around the globe.  \"Climate variability\" refers to short-term (weeks to decades) changes in some of these same environmental conditions for a given place and time. Climate variability is often the result of natural oscillations in Earth's climate system \u2014 such as the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Pacific-North American Teleconnection Pattern, etc. These oscillations and other similar phenomena can influence weather and climate patterns around the globe.",

You find the following temperature readings (Fahrenheit) for the last few hours: 99.2, 99.8, 1000, 101.4. You'd know immediately that the third number was a mistake. To make a realistic assessment of the patient's condition, you'd have to either adjust it or throw it out.  Weather observers are as human as nurses, and they also make occasional mistakes in recording and transcribing their observations: impossibly high highs and low lows, the exact same temperatures for two months in a row, etc. The first step in data processing is quality control: identifying and eliminating erroneous data.", 
  "VXBZPLKJPFAYJFIIUMW": "No. The sun can influence the Earth\u2019s climate, but it isn\u2019t responsible for the warming trend we\u2019ve seen over the past few decades. The sun is a giver of life; it helps keep the planet warm enough for us to survive. We know subtle changes in the Earth\u2019s orbit around the sun are responsible for the comings and goings of the ice ages. But the warming we\u2019ve seen over the last few decades is too rapid to be linked to changes in Earth\u2019s orbit, and too large to be caused by solar activity. In fact, recently (2005-2010) the sun has become less active, while temperatures have marched upwards.  One of the \u201csmoking guns\u201d that tells us the sun is not causing global warming comes from looking at the amount of the sun\u2019s energy that hits the top of the atmosphere. Since 1978, scientists have been tracking this using sensors on satellites and what they tell us is that there has been no upward trend in the amount of the sun\u2019s energy reaching Earth.", 
  "VXLECPRDENDUJACVNXG": "Yes, climate change can and has altered the risk of certain types of extreme weather events. The harmful effects of severe weather raise concerns about how the risk of such events might be altered by climate change. An unusually warm month, a major flood or a drought, a series of intense rainstorms, an active tornado season, landfall of a major hurricane, a big snowstorm, or an unusually severe winter inevitably lead to questions about possible connections to climate change.", 
  "WBYOIFLVHWRLJQI": "Multiple lines of evidence show that climate change is happening as a result of human activities. Climate change is altering the world around us, and these changes will become increasingly evident with each passing decade. Climate change is already leading to more intense rainfall events and other extreme weather patterns. It will lead to more droughts in some areas, more floods in others, and more frequent heat waves in many areas. Changing temperature and precipitation patterns, as well as increasing sea level, are important factors affecting various parts of the United States. For example, the risks associated with wildfires in the western U.S. are increasing, and coastal inundation is becoming a common occurrence in low-lying areas. Water supply availability is changing in many parts of the United States.", 
  "WEMFPFSCUPNETBXYJC": "We are still a long way from being able to simulate the climate with a true first principles calculation. While many basic aspects of physics can be included (conservation of mass, energy etc.), many need to be approximated for reasons of efficiency or resolutions (i.e. the equations of motion need estimates of sub-gridscale turbulent effects, radiative transfer codes approximate the line-by-line calculations using band averaging), and still others are only known empirically (the formula for how fast clouds turn to rain for instance). With these approximations and empirical formulae, there is often a tunable parameter or two that can be varied in order to improve the match to whatever observations exist. Adjusting these values is described as tuning and falls into two categories. First, there is the tuning in a single formula in order for that formula to best match the observed values of that specific relationship. This happens most frequently when new parameterisations are being developed.  Secondly, there are tuning parameters that control aspects of the emergent system. Gravity wave drag parameters are not very constrained by data, and so are often tuned to improve the climatology of stratospheric zonal winds. The threshold relative humidity for making clouds is tuned often to get the most realistic cloud cover and global albedo. Surprisingly, there are very few of these (maybe a half dozen) that are used in adjusting the models to match the data. It is important to note that these exercises are done with the mean climate (including the seasonal cycle and some internal variability) \u2013 and once set they are kept fixed for any perturbation experiment.", 
  "WOWJCSNPJLYSYLTUW": "The sun is the source of most of the energy that drives the biological and physical processes in the world around us\u2014in oceans and on land it fuels plant growth that forms the base of the food chain, and in the atmosphere it warms air which drives our weather. The rate of energy coming from the sun changes slightly day to day. Over many millennia in the Earth-Sun orbital relationship can change the geographical distribution of the sun\u2019s energy over the Earth\u2019s surface. It has been suggested that changes in solar output might affect our climate\u2014both directly, by changing the rate of solar heating of the Earth and atmosphere, and indirectly, by changing cloud forming processes.   Over the time-scale of millions of years the change in solar intensity is a critical factor influencing climate (e.g., ice ages).  However, changes in solar heating rate over the last century cannot account for the magnitude and distribution of the rise in global mean temperature during that time period and there is no convincing evidence for significant indirect influences on our climate due to twentieth century changes in solar output.", 
  "WQGQEEGVLGWNLLJRRT": "Yes, the increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases during the industrial era are caused by human activities. In fact, the observed increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations does not reveal the full extent of human emissions in that it accounts for only 55% of the CO2 released by human activity since 1959. The rest has been taken up by plants on land and by the oceans. In all cases, atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, and their increases, are determined by the balance between sources (emissions of the gas from human activities and natural systems) and sinks (the removal of the gas from the atmosphere by conversion to a different chemical compound). Fossil fuel combustion (plus a smaller contribution from cement manufacture) is responsible for more than 75% of human-caused CO2 emissions. Land use change (primarily deforestation) is responsible for the remainder. For methane, another important greenhouse gas, emissions generated by human activities exceeded natural emissions over the last 25 years. For nitrous oxide, emissions generated by human activities are equal to natural emissions to the atmosphere. Most of the long-lived halogen-containing gases (such as chlorofluorcarbons) are manufactured by humans, and were not present in the atmosphere before the industrial era. On average, present-day tropospheric ozone has increased 38% since pre-industrial times, and the increase results from atmospheric reactions of short-lived pollutants emitted by human activity. The concentration of CO2 is now 379 parts per million (ppm) and methane is greater than 1,774 parts per billion (ppb), both very likely much higher than any time in at least 650 kyr (during which CO2 remained between 180 and 300 ppm and methane between 320 and 790 ppb). The recent rate of change is dramatic and unprecedented; increases in CO2 never exceeded 30 ppm in 1 kyr \u2013 yet now CO2 has risen by 30 ppm in just the last 17 years. ", 
  "WRECBCARYXDDCZU": "There are natural sources of carbon dioxide, such as decomposing biomass, venting volcanoes, naturally occurring wildfires, human and animal respiration, etc. Over geological time spans before the industrial revolution, these natural sources of carbon dioxide were in balance with natural \"sinks\"\u2014such as the ocean, phytoplankton, and plants on land that absorb carbon dioxide. The only new process on Earth that has been identified that can account for the significant tipping of Earth's carbon balance is humans burning ever increasing amounts of fossil fuels together with other large-scale activities like deforestation, biomass burning, and cement production.[14] Since the industrial revolution, human activities have increased the abundance of carbon dioxide in the lower atmosphere by about 40%.", 
  "WRGIBOTNINKBXUMBBE": "Yes, human activities exert a cooling influence on Earth in several ways. Overall, this cooling influence is smaller than the warming influence of the heat-trapping gases humans put into the air.[14]  Particulate pollution (aerosols) is humanity's greatest cooling influence.[14] Plumes of aerosols are produced by: power plants and large-scale industrial processes; smoke and gases from biomass burning; windblown dust from deforested areas, dried wetlands, and crop fields; and exhaust from ships, cars, trucks, buses, and trains. Most aerosol particles scatter the sun's rays back to space, thereby directly exerting a cooling influence by reducing the amount of sunlight reaching the surface. Aerosols also have an indirect cooling influence by producing brighter white (more reflective) and longer-lived clouds that reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the surface. Aerosols' indirect cooling influence via clouds contributes twice as much cooling as their direct cooling influence outside of clouds. But to keep aerosols' cooling influence in proper perspective, their cooling influence is only about one-third as large as the current warming effect of human-produced heat-trapping gases.[32]  Whereas aerosols linger in the atmosphere from days to a few weeks, heat-trapping gases that humans release to the atmosphere linger from decades to centuries. Plus, when it was recognized that human particle pollution causes other undesired harmful side effects\u2014such as acid rain and human respiratory diseases and deaths\u2014the United States and other nations adopted regulations to reduce emissions of some aerosols.  Another measurable way in which humans exert a cooling influence is by changing land cover over large areas in ways that increase the land's reflectance, thereby reducing the amount of sunlight absorbed. By comparison, the cooling influence of humanity's land cover changes only offsets about 5% of the warming caused by human-emitted heat-trapping gases", 
  "WRODTFQXUNBYLZGGLNY": "The number of land surface weather stations in the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) drops off in recent years. This fact is an indication of our success in adding historical data. Every month data from over 1,200 stations from around the world are added to GHCN as a result of monthly reports transmitted over the Global Telecommunication System. This number is up from what it was a decade ago due to systematic efforts by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) and others to encourage countries to send in CLIMAT reports. If NCEI relied solely on such data that would be the maximum number of stations available. But we have systematically sought to increase the data holdings in the past through international projects such as the once a decade creation of World Weather Records as well as NCEI's own digitization of select Colonial Era archive data. The creation of the GCOS Surface Network is one example of a specific attempt to both enhance data exchange around the world and to identify and select the 'best' stations for long-term climate change purposes. The weighting scheme used to rate stations for the initial selection in the GSN clearly indicates the biases climatologists have in favor of stations that have been in operation for a long time, that are rural, are agricultural research sites, and are distributed throughout the world with increasing density the farther they are away from the tropics. The result of all these efforts is that GHCN has data for many thousands of stations in the period from the 1950s to the 1990s that cannot be routinely updated, thus the number of stations drops considerably in recent years.  Because 71 percent of the world is covered by oceans, NCEI also has a strong focus on collection of observations over the world's oceans. The global ocean temperature analysis is primarily based on buoy and ship observations from the International Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Dataset (ICOADS), while monthly data updates come from the Global Telecommunications System (GTS). NCEI is active in a continuing multi-decadal effort to digitize historical ocean observations that contribute to ICOADS. The number of sea surface temperature observations in ICOADS has increased due to recent digitization by NCEI. Other parts of NOAA are involved in ocean buoy deployments that also contribute to ICOADS and the GTS data streams. NOAA continues to seek to increase the amount of data available for global analyses.",

However, the most definitive warming has been happening in the ocean, which has absorbed more than 80% of the additional energy in the climate system.[2,3] Measurements show that while the rate of air temperature warming slowed in the early part of the 21st century, the ocean continued to warm at an unusually rapid rate.",

But in the last century or so, humans have been interfering with the energy balance of the planet, mainly through the burning of fossil fuels that give off additional carbon dioxide into the air.

The problem is that since there are so many possible causes, we can\u2019t possibly know about them all.

One proposed method of partially meeting our energy needs and reducing CO\u2082 concentrations is called BioEnergy Carbon Capture and Storage. It would involve growing biofuels for energy, then capturing and burying the carbon dioxide released by these fuels. While potentially important, its large-scale deployment poses important questions regarding its costs and benefits and how the large amount of agricultural land required would compete with food production to feed the world\u2019s growing population.  To keep climate change below 2\u2103, some have proposed a need for more radical geoengineering options if emissions are not phased out quickly enough.

The major public health organizations of the world have said that climate change is a critical public health problem. According to the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, climate change makes many existing diseases and conditions worse, and it helps pests and pathogens spread into new regions. The most vulnerable people\u2014children, the elderly, the poor, and those with health conditions\u2014are at increased risk for climate-related health effects.[26]  Global warming is also a threat to the economy and national security in many developing nations. Because societies and their built environments have developed under a climate that has fluctuated within a relatively small range of conditions, most impacts of a rapidly changing climate will present challenges\u2014particularly as extreme weather and climate conditions become more extreme, more frequent, and longer lasting. In developing nations, populations are much more vulnerable to weather and climate extremes and are less able to adapt. Any climate-related impacts on scarce natural resources, food, and water are more likely to trigger humanitarian crises or armed conflicts that can destabilize nations, or whole regions.[12]  In the United States, the most rapidly growing population is in the Mountain West. That region is projected to experience more frequent and more severe wildfires with less water availability, particularly during the high-demand period of summer. Because of high demand for irrigating agriculture, overuse of rivers and streams is common in the arid West, particularly along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, in Southern California, and in the Central Valley of California. Rapid population and economic growth in these arid and semi-arid regions has dramatically increased people's vulnerability to water shortages.",

Greenhouse gases and aerosols affect climate by altering incoming solar radiation and outgoing infrared (thermal) radiation that are part of Earth\u2019s energy balance. Changing the atmospheric abundance or properties of these gases and particles can lead to a warming or cooling of the climate system.

EPA\u2019s ENERGY STAR program, a voluntary initiative that drives more widespread use of energy-efficient products and practices, has saved U.S. businesses, organizations, and consumers more than $362 billion in energy costs since 1992 while avoiding more than 2 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions.", 
  "YOIEVTAKNVGIQQHVQN": "Many lines of evidence demonstrate that human activities are primarily responsible for recent climate changes. First, basic physics dictates that increasing the concentration of CO2 and other heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere will cause the climate to warm. Second, modeling studies show that when human influences are removed from the equation, climate would actually have cooled slightly over the past half century. And third, the pattern of warming through the layers of atmosphere demonstrates that human-induced heat-trapping gases are responsible, rather than some natural change.", 
  "YPUGCRGKJTJSTKHEDZ": " Existing data have well documented biases in them. The most important bias globally was the modification in measured sea surface temperatures associated with the change from ships throwing a bucket over the side, bringing some ocean water on deck, and putting a thermometer in it, to reading the thermometer in the engine coolant water intake. The bucket readings used early in the record were cooler than engine intake observations so the early data have been adjusted warmer to remove that bias. This makes global temperatures indicate less warming than the raw data. The NOAA Sea Surface Temperature bias-correction method that is applied to the historical data from the 1940\u2019s and earlier is based on a comparison between nighttime marine air temperatures and SSTs from ICOADS.", 
  "YQRBWNDJHKBOKLCC": "There is an abundance of scientific evidence that shows major and widespread climate changes have occurred with startling speed. For example, roughly half of the warming of the North Atlantic Ocean since the last ice age was achieved in only a decade, and this warming was accompanied by significant changes in climate across most of the globe. Research over the past decade has shown that these abrupt - or nonlinear - climate changes have been especially common when the climate system was being forced to change most rapidly. Thus, the rate of buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may increase the possibility of large, abrupt and unwelcome regional or global climate events.  The mechanisms of past abrupt climate changes are not yet fully understood, and climate models typically underestimate the size, speed and extent of those changes. Hence, future abrupt changes cannot be predicted with confidence. Yet, because of greenhouse warming and other human alterations of the earth system, and the long lifetime of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, certain thresholds are likely to be crossed and we will not know we have crossed them until it is too late to alter the outcome.", 
  "YRYENXVTYOKBQCDP": "Climate refers to average weather conditions over many years. For example, the climate in Minnesota is cold and snowy in the winter, while the climate in Hawai'i is warm and humid all year long. Weather, in contrast, refers to a specific event or condition that happens over a period of hours or days. For example, a thunderstorm, a snowstorm, and today's temperature all describe weather. ", 
  "YSTZIHBOFZIEJAZIDIP": "When people think of NASA, they think of rovers on Mars, astronauts floating aboard the International Space Station, or probes veering out to the edge of the solar system. They don\u2019t necessarily link NASA with climate research and observations. But Earth is a planet too, and NASA is one of the biggest players in the Earth science arena, with broad expertise on observing our climate, especially from the vantage point of space. Today it spends over a billion dollars a year doing Earth science and has more than a dozen satellites in orbit around the planet watching the oceans, land, ice, atmosphere and biosphere. In the 1970s, NASA\u2019s planetary exploration budget fell dramatically. It was then that the agency really got into the business of studying our home planet from orbit. It was also a time when people were beginning to realize that our climate could change relatively fast, on the scale of the human lifespan. Today, we know that our climate is changing at an unprecedented rate and that humans are a key part of that change. NASA continues to launch new satellite missions, and is also relying on aircraft (manned and unmanned), as well as scientists on the ground, to take vital measurements of things like snowpack and hurricanes, augmenting the big-picture view we get from space.  NASA\u2019s role is to make observations of our Earth system that can be used by the public, policymakers and to support strategic decisions. Its job is to do rigorous science. However, the agency does not promote particular climate policies.", 
  "YTRBZATQVFLYHOS": "Global warming refers to the increasing average global temperature since the Industrial Revolution. The average global temperature has increased by about 0.8 degrees Celsius (1.4 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1880. Global warming is an ongoing process; scientists expect the average global temperature to rise an additional 0.3 to 0.7 degrees Celsius through 2035.", 
  "YVTESCRCCWICTYGGDN": "A recent study conducted by scientists at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information found no evidence that the U.S. temperature trend is inflated by poor siting of stations that comprise the US Historical Climatology Network (USHCN). NCEI scientists conducted this study to determine the reliability of surface temperature trends over the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) following photographic documentation of poor siting conditions at USHCN stations. A comparison of trends derived from poorly and well-sited USHCN stations indicates that there is a bias associated with poor exposure sites in the unadjusted USHCN version 2 data (relative to data from good exposure sites). However, this bias is consistent with previous studies documenting the impact of the widespread conversion to electronic sensors in the USHCN during the last 25 years because the majority of poor exposure sites were subject to this instrument change. Of significant note, the sign of the bias is counterintuitive to photographic documentation of poor exposure because associated instrument changes led to an artificial negative (\"cool\") bias in maximum temperatures and only a slight positive (\"warm\") bias in minimum temperatures. Adjustments largely account for the impact of instrument and siting changes but appear to leave a small overall residual negative (\"cool\") bias in the adjusted USHCN version 2 CONUS average maximum temperature. The adjusted USHCN CONUS temperatures are well aligned with recent measurements from NOAA's U.S. Climate Reference Network (designed with the highest climate monitoring standards for siting and instrument exposure), thus providing independent evidence that the USHCN provides an accurate measure of the U.S. temperature. The results of this study underscore the need to consider all changes in observation practice when determining the impacts of siting irregularities.", 
  "YZEIVOVRTGFZTZPGUX": "Weather and climate occur on different scales of time and space, and depend on different aspects of Earth's environment. Weather describes atmospheric conditions at a particular time and place. Climate is the overall statistical characteristics of weather and environmental conditions, such as long-term averages and ranges of variability, for a given place and season.  Weather forecasters look at initial conditions and then make short-term deterministic predictions about future events (from minutes to days, to less than 2 weeks). Due to the fluid and chaotic nature of the atmosphere, it is impossible to make accurate deterministic predictions about weather events more than 2 weeks in the future. Climate forecasters look at the state of the key controlling parameters of the climate system and then make long-term probabilistic predictions about future conditions (from more than 2 weeks to years, to decades). People do this all the time with high reliability. For example, while you don't know what the weather will be a like on a given day in Washington, D.C., in the year 2020, you can be confident that temperatures will be warmer in the summer than in the winter.  Another way to understand the differences between deterministic and probabilistic predictions is to consider how other types of experts use them. For example, a doctor may have a hard time determining exactly when a particular overweight, middle-aged person who smokes cigarettes is going to die. But a life insurance agent can easily make a probabilistic prediction of the person's life expectancy based on the average life spans of millions of overweight, middle-aged people who smoked.", 
  "ZDBUOBQRCKCPYCKAM": "The answer is no! We need to get an idea of all the possible ways the atmosphere could develop, and what the likelihood, or probability, of each possible way is. The way we do this is by running ensembles of Global Climate Model (GCM) runs. An ensemble is a collection of runs of the same GCM, which differ very slightly in their initial conditions, or their parameterisations. For example, there might be a 1% difference in wind speed over Oxford between the different models.  Ensemble sizes vary hugely. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) currently uses an ensemble of 50 members to make the weather forecast. In climateprediction.net, we\u2019re hoping for ensembles with millions of members. It will then be possible to build up statistics for how many ensemble members produced each possible outcome.  If we were trying to predict temperature change, our best guess at what the temperature is actually going to do is the one that most runs predicted, i.e. the one with the greatest probability.", 
  "ZECBNMIRJVCVDYZG": "While it's not a perfect analogy, some say the atmosphere works like a greenhouse. The sun's rays (shortwave energy) enter a greenhouse through its glass ceiling and walls to warm the interior. The glass makes it hard for the heat (longwave energy) to escape, and heat builds up inside the greenhouse until the heat can escape fast enough.  Certain naturally occurring gases in Earth's atmosphere have a similar warming effect on the surface. This warming is referred to as the \"greenhouse effect,\" and the gases that trap heat are called \"greenhouse gases.\" The most important greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and ozone. Earth's surface must warm to an average of about 59\u00b0F (with present-day concentrations) until enough energy can be emitted by greenhouse gases and escape to space to balance the energy being absorbed from the Sun.  Though these important greenhouse gases occur naturally in the atmosphere in varying concentrations, human activities are directly and indirectly increasing their abundance. In addition, other greenhouse gases not normally found in nature are being added to the atmosphere. The net result is to intensify Earth's greenhouse effect, causing Earth's surface to warm.", 
  "ZEKXWQADAZPIXZTUAA": "Greenhouse gases, such as CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide, act like a blanket around the planet. They trap energy in the atmosphere and cause it to warm. This phenomenon, called the greenhouse effect, is natural and necessary to support life on Earth: without it the Earth\u2019s average temperature would be around 0\u00b0F. But scientists agree that the continuing buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere\u2014caused mainly by the burning of fossil fuels for energy\u2014will upset the natural energy balance and change Earth's climate, with potentially dangerous risks to human health, infrastructure, the economy, and ecosystems.

  "ZFUJKLHTGWTPASB": "Modern observations mostly come from weather stations, weather balloons, radars, ships and buoys, and satellites. A surprisingly large number of U.S. measurements are still made by volunteer weather watchers. There are more than 8,700 citizen observers in the National Weather Service's Cooperative Observer Program who log daily weather data. On the oceans, moored and drifting buoys have begun to replace ships in recent decades as the primary method for measuring temperatures at sea.  The U.S. organization responsible for preserving the global climate record is the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Other nations also maintain archives of global weather and climate observations.", 
  "ZKGSMCRILCYSATRXJN": "Hundreds of independent lines of evidence confirm that our climate is changing. For example, scientists have documented long-term changes around the world in temperature, precipitation, sea level, and the amount of heat stored in the ocean. Especially dramatic changes are underway in the Arctic, where warming is amplified by powerful feedbacks. Reductions in sea ice, land-based ice, and snow cover, along with the thawing of permafrost, are having profound impacts in the Arctic and beyond. Rising sea levels, caused mainly by the expansion of seawater as it warms, along with billions of tons of water added to the ocean each year from melting glaciers, ice caps, and ice sheets, are affecting coastal communities in many parts of the world, including places like South Florida, Chesapeake Bay, and low-lying communities along the Gulf Coast in the United States. Changes in the length of growing seasons and pollen seasons, the timing of bird migrations, and range shifts in plants and wildlife provide still more evidence for recent changes in climate.", 
  "ZKQTBUZJEZVCAWR": "Global warming contributes to rising sea levels in two ways. First, the Earth\u2019s polar regions are especially vulnerable to global warming because temperatures in the Arctic and Antarctic are rising at twice the rate of the world average. Hotter summers, warmer winters, and earlier springs are causing glaciers and ice sheets to gradually melt. The increased runoff from polar lands (particularly Greenland and the Antarctic) is causing sea levels to rise. Second, thermal expansion, the natural expansion of water as it heats up, is causing the ocean to take up more space, which also leads to rising sea levels.  Sea levels are currently rising by about one foot per century and scientists estimate that by 2100, the Earth\u2019s oceans will have risen one to four feet. This will increase the risk of coastal flooding and endanger millions of people living in low-lying coastal areas like New York, Los Angeles, and Miami. In fact, the sea level along the Atlantic Coast is rising faster than anywhere else on the planet.", 
  "ZUMPTNRCHKGEPSB": "Global average temperature increases in recent decades are primarily due to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere resulting from human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels. Yet, the magnitude of the anthropogenic influence on regional climate remains uncertain. A principal reason is because the effects of human activities are superimposed on the background \"noise\" of natural climate variability, which can be very large regionally.  Global warming does not mean that temperature increases are spatially uniform or monotonic: some places warm more than the average and some places cool. Regional changes in temperature are often associated with changes natural patterns (or modes) of the atmospheric and oceanic circulation, such as the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. Changes in the climate system from human activities may affect these modes, however, so quantifying the anthropogenic and natural components of the observed warming on regional scales remains a difficult and critical research question.  Many global climate models, for instance, project changes in the statistics of ENSO variability with global warming, specifically of greater ENSO activity marked by larger interannual variations relative to the warmer mean state. More El Ni\u00f1o events would increase the probability of weather regimes that favor, for instance, regional cooling over the North Pacific Ocean with warming over much of northwest North America. Yet, the details of ENSO are not well enough simulated in climate models to have full confidence in these projected changes, in part because the positive atmosphere-ocean feedbacks involved with ENSO mean that small errors in simulating the relevant processes can be amplified.  Thus, while it is likely that changes in ENSO and other natural modes of climate variability will occur as a result of anthropogenic climate change, their nature, how large and rapid they will be, and their implications for regional climate change around the world remain uncertain.", 
  "ZVKMVSWWKMGWTPGYLI": "A carbon footprint is the amount of carbon emitted by a person, group, household, organization, or activity over a given time period, usually due to the consumption of fossil fuels. The more fossil fuels are consumed during an activity, the larger the carbon footprint (for example, flying results in a larger carbon footprint than taking a train to cover the same distance). Activities that are part of the natural carbon cycle, such as breathing, are not counted. A carbon footprint can also encompass emissions of other greenhouse gases, such as methane.  Reducing or offsetting greenhouse gas emissions by improving energy efficiency, using renewable energy, and adopting sustainable practices is the best way to reduce one's carbon footprint. Simple things like carpooling, using LED light bulbs, and recycling are just a few of the many ways you can reduce your carbon footprint and fight climate change.", 
  "ZZLIFGESJOQTFPCSSM": "Yes. Observations show a global-scale decline of snow and ice over many years, especially since 1980 and increasing during the past decade, despite growth in some places and little change in others (Figure 1). Most mountain glaciers are getting smaller. Snow cover is retreating earlier in the spring. Sea ice in the Arctic is shrinking in all seasons, most dramatically in summer. Reductions are reported in permafrost, seasonally frozen ground and river and lake ice. Important coastal regions of the ice sheets on Greenland and West Antarctica, and the glaciers of the Antarctic Peninsula, are thinning and contributing to sea level rise. The total contribution of glacier, ice cap and ice sheet melt to sea level rise is estimated as 1.2 \u00b1 0.4 mm yr\u20131 for the period 1993 to 2003.",
